The Project Gutenberg Etext of Wolfville, by Alfred Henry Lewis

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net
http://promo.net/pg


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03
or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of July 12, 2001 contributions are only being solicited from people in:

We have filed in about 45 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met,
additions to this list will be made and fund raising
will begin in the additional states.  Please feel
free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork
to legally request donations in all 50 states.  If
your state is not listed and you would like to know
if we have added it since the list you have, just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in
states where we are not yet registered, we know
of no prohibition against accepting donations
from donors in these states who approach us with
an offer to donate.


International donations are accepted,
but we don't know ANYTHING about how
to make them tax-deductible, or
even if they CAN be made deductible,
and don't have the staff to handle it
even if there are ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
Project Gutenberg is dedicated to increasing the number of
public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form.

The Project gratefully accepts contributions of money, time,
public domain materials, or royalty free copyright licenses.

    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> These tales by the Old Cattleman have been submitted to perhaps a
      <br /> dozen people. They have read, criticised, and advised. The advice
      <br /> was good; the criticism just. Some suggested a sketch which might in
      <br /> detail set forth Toffville; there were those who wanted something
      <br /> like a picture of the Old Cattleman; while others urged an <br />
      elaboration of the personal characteristics of Old Man Enright, Doc <br />
      Peets, Cherokee Hall, Moore, Tutt, Boggs, Faro Nell, Old Monte, and <br />
      Texas Thompson. I have, how-ever, concluded to leave all these <br />
      matters to the illustrations of Mr. Remington and the imaginations <br />
      of those who read. I think it the better way-certainly it is the <br />
      easier one for me. I shall therefore permit the Old Cattleman to <br />
      tell his stories in his own fashion. The style will be crude, <br />
      abrupt, and meagre, but I trust it will prove as satisfactory to the <br />
      reader as it has to me. <br /> A. H. L. <br /> New York, May 15,1897. <br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. WOLFVILLE'S FIRST FUNERAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "These yere obsequies which I'm about mentionin'," observed the Old
      Cattleman, "is the first real funeral Wolfville has."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow had lighted a cob pipe and tilted his chair back in a
      fashion which proclaimed a plan to be comfortable. He had begun to
      tolerate&mdash;even encourage&mdash;my society, although it was clear that
      as a tenderfoot he regarded me with a species of gentle disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had provoked the subject of funeral ceremonies by a recurrence to the
      affair of the Yellowhouse Man, and a query as to what would have been the
      programme of the public-spirited hamlet of Wolfville if that invalid had
      died instead of yielding to the nursing of Jack Moore and that tariff on
      draw-poker which the genius of Old Man Enright decreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came in easy illustration, as answer to my question, for the Old
      Cattleman to recall the funeral of a former leading spirit of Southwestern
      society. The name of this worthy was Jack King; and with a brief
      exposition of his more salient traits, my grizzled raconteur led down to
      his burial with the remark before quoted.
    </p>

      "Of course," continued the Old Cattleman, "of course while thar's some
      like this Yallerhouse gent who survives; thar's others of the boys who is
      downed one time an' another, an' goes shoutin' home to heaven by various
      trails. But ontil the event I now recalls, the remainders has been
      freighted east or west every time, an' the camp gets left. It's hard luck,
      but at last it comes toward us; an' thar we be one day with a corpse all
      our'n, an' no partnership with nobody nor nothin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's the chance of our life,' says Doc Peets, 'an' we plays it. Thar's
      nothin' too rich for our blood, an' these obsequies is goin' to be
      spread-eagle, you bet! We'll show Red Dog an' sim'lar villages they ain't
      sign-camps compared with Wolfville.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we begins to draw in our belts an' get a big ready. Jack King, as I
      says before, is corpse, eemergin' outen a game of poker as sech. Which
      prior tharto, Jack's been peevish, an' pesterin' an' pervadin' 'round for
      several days. The camp stands a heap o' trouble with him an' tries to
      smooth it along by givin' him his whiskey an' his way about as he wants
      'em, hopin' for a change. But man is only human, an' when Jack starts in
      one night to make a flush beat a tray full for seven hundred dollars, he
      asks too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar ain't no ondertakers, so we rounds up the outfit, an' knowin' he'd
      take a pride in it, an' do the slam-up thing, we puts in Doc Peets to deal
      the game unanimous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gents,' he says, as we-alls turns into the Red Light to be refreshed,
      'in assoomin' the present pressure I feels the compliments paid me in the
      seelection. I shall act for the credit of the camp, an' I needs your help.
      I desires that these rites be a howlin' vict'ry. I don't want people
      comin' 'round next week allowin' thar ain't been no funeral, an' I don't
      reckon much that they will. We've got the corpse, an' if we gets bucked
      off now it's our fault.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he app'ints Old Monte an' Dan Boggs to go for a box for Jack, an'
      details a couple of niggers from the corral to dig a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' mind you-alls,' says Peets, `I wants that hole at least a mile from
      camp. In order to make a funeral a success, you needs distance. That's
      where deceased gets action. It gives the procession a chance to spread an'
      show up. You can't make no funeral imposin' except you're plumb liberal on
      distances.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all goes smooth right off the reel. We gets a box an' grave ready, an'
      Peets sticks up a notice on the stage-station door, settin' the excitement
      for third-drink time next day. Prompt at the drop of the hat the camp lets
      go all holds an' turns loose in a body to put Jack through right. He's
      laid out in splendid shape in the New York Store, with nothin' to complain
      of if he's asked to make the kick himse'f. He has a new silk necktie, blue
      shirt an' pearl buttons, trousers, an' boots. Some one&mdash;Benson Annie,
      I reckons&mdash;has pasted some co't plaster over the hole on his
      cheek-bone where the bullet gets in, an' all 'round Jack looks better than
      I ever sees him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Let the congregation remove its hats,' says Peets, a-settin' down on a
      box up at Jack's head, 'an' as many as can will please get somethin' to
      camp on. Now, my friends," he continues, "thar ain't no need of my puttin'
      on any frills or gettin' in any scroll work. The objects of this
      convention is plain an' straight. Mister King, here present, is dead.
      Deceased is a very headstrong person, an' persists yesterday in
      entertainin' views touchin' a club flush, queen at the head, which results
      in life everlastin'. Now, gents, this is a racket full of solemnity. We
      wants nothin' but good words. Don't mind about the trooth; which the same
      ain't in play at a funeral, nohow. We all knows Jack; we knows his record.
      Our information is ample that a-way; how he steals a hoss at Tucson; how
      be robs a gent last fall at Tombstone; how he downs a party at Cruces; how
      that scar on his neck he gets from Wells-Fargo's people when he stands up
      the stage over on the Lordsburg trail. But we lays it all aside to- day.
      We don't copper nary bet. Yesterday mornin', accompanied by the report of
      a Colt's forty-five, Mister King, who lies yere so cool an' easy, leaves
      us to enter in behind the great white shinin' gates of pearl an' gold,
      which swings inward to glory eternal. It's a great set back at this time
      thar ain't no sky-pilot in the camp. This deeficiency in sky-pilots is a
      hoss onto us, but we does our best. At a time like this I hears that
      singin' is a good, safe break, an' I tharfore calls on that little girl
      from Flagstaff to give us "The Dyin' Ranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the little Flagstaff girl cl'ars her valves with a drink, an' gives us
      the song; an' when the entire congregation draws kyards on the last verse
      it does everybody good.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Far away from his dear old Texas,
     We laid him down to rest;
     With his saddle for a pillow,
     And his gun across his breast.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Then Peets gets out the Scriptures. 'I'm goin' to read a chapter outen
      these yere Testaments,' he says. 'I ain't makin' no claim for it, except
      it's part of the game an' accordin' to Hoyle. If thar's a preacher yere
      he'd do it, but bein' thar's no sech brand on this range I makes it as a
      forced play myse'f.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he reads us, a chapter about the sepulcher, an' Mary Magdalene, an'
      the resurrection; an' everybody takes it in profound as prairie- dogs, for
      that's the lead to make, an' we knows it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Peets allows he'd like to hear from any gent onder the head of 'good
      of the order.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mister Ondertaker an' Chairman,' says Jim Hamilton, 'I yields to an
      inward impulse to say that this yere play weighs on me plumb heavy. As
      keeper of the dance-hall I sees a heap of the corpse an' knows him well.
      Mister King is my friend, an' while his moods is variable an' oncertain;
      an' it's cl'arly worth while to wear your gun while he's hoverin' near, I
      loves him. He has his weaknesses, as do we all. A disp'sition to make new
      rooles as he plays along for sech games of chance as enjoys his notice is
      perhaps his greatest failin'. His givin' way to this habit is primar'ly
      the cause of his bein' garnered in. I hopes he'll get along thar, an'
      offers a side bet, even money, up to five hundred dollars, he will. He may
      alter his system an' stand way up with the angels an' seraphs, an' if
      words from me could fix it, I'd shorely stack 'em in. I would say further
      that after consultin' with Billy Burns, who keeps the Red Light, we has,
      in honor of the dead an' to mark the occasion of his cashin' in, agreed
      upon a business departure of interest to all. This departure Mister Burns
      will state. I mournfully gives way to him for said purpose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mister Peets, an' ladies an' gents,' says Burns, 'like Mister Hamilton,
      who I'm proud to meet yere as gent, citizen, an' friend, I knows deceased.
      He's a good man, an' a dead-game sport from 'way back. A protracted
      wrastle with the remorseless drinks of the frontier had begun to tell on
      him, an' for a year or so he's been liable to have spells. Referrin' to
      the remarks of Mister Hamilton, I states that by agreement between us an'
      in honor to departed, the quotations on whiskey in this yere camp, from
      now on, will be two drinks for two bits, instead of one as previous. We
      don't want to onsettle trade, an' we don't believe this will. We makes it
      as a ray of light in the darkness an' gloom of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After this yere utterance, which is well received, we forms the
      procession. Doc Peets, with two buglers from the Fort, takes the lead,
      with Jack an' his box in one of the stage coaches comin' next. Enright,
      Tutt, Boggs, Short Creek Dave, Texas Thompson, an' me, bein' the six
      pallbearers, is on hosses next in line; an' Jack Moore commandin' of the
      rest of the outfit, lines out permiscus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This is a great day for Wolfville," says Peets, as he rides up an' down
      the line. 'Thar ain't no camp this side of St. Looey could turn this
      trick. Which I only wishes Jack could see it himse'f. It's more calculated
      to bring this outfit into fav'rable notice than a lynchin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the grave we turns in an' gives three cheers for King, an' three for
      Doc Peets; an' last we gives three more an' a tiger for the camp. The
      buglers cuts loose everythin' they knows, from the 'water- call' to the
      'retreat,' an' while the niggers is a-shovelin' in the sand we bangs away
      with our six-shooters for general results delightful. You can gamble thar
      ain't been no funeral like it before or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the last Peets hauls outen the stage we uses for Jack, a headboard.
      When it's set up it looks like if Jack ain't satisfied, he's shorely hard
      to suit. On it in big letters is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      "'You sees, we has to work in a little sentiment,' says Doc Peets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we details the niggers to stand watch-an'-watch every night till
      further orders. No; we ain't afraid Jack'll get out none, but the coyotes
      is shore due to come an' dig for him, so the niggers has to stand gyard.
      We don't allow to find spec'mens of Jack spread 'round loose after all the
      trouble we takes."

      CHAPTER II. THE STINGING LIZARD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Thar's no sorter doubt to it," said the Old Cattleman after a long pause
      devoted to meditation, and finally to the refilling of his cob pipe, "thar
      ain't the slightest room for cavil but them ceremonies over Jack King,
      deceased, is the most satisfactory pageant Wolfville ever promotes."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point I proved my cunning by saying nothing. I was pleased
      to hear the old man talk, and rightly theorized that the better method of
      invoking his reminiscences just at this time was to say never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," he continued, "I don't reckon it's many weeks after we follows
      Jack to the tomb, when we comes a heap near schedoolin' another funeral,
      with the general public a-contributin' of the corpse. To be speecific, I
      refers to a occasion when we-alls comes powerful close to lynchin'
      Cherokee Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind on bosomin' myself about it. It's all a misonderstandin';
      the same bein' Cherokee's fault complete. We don't know him more'n to
      merely drink with at that eepock, an' he's that sly an' furtive in his
      plays, an' covers his trails so speshul, he nacherally breeds sech
      suspicions that when the stage begins to be stood up reg'lar once a week,
      an' all onaccountable, Cherokee comes mighty close to culminatin' in a
      rope. Which goes to show that you can't be too open an' free in your game,
      an' Cherokee would tell you so himse'f.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere tangle I'm thinkin' of ain't more'n a month after Cherokee
      takes to residin' in Wolfville. He comes trailin' in one evenin' from
      Tucson, an' onfolds a layout an' goes to turnin' faro- bank in the Red
      Light. No one remarks this partic'lar, which said spectacles is frequent.
      The general idee is that Cherokee's on the squar' an' his game is
      straight, an' of course public interest don't delve no further into his
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherokee, himse'f, is one of these yere slim, silent people who ain't
      talkin' much, an' his eye for color is one of them raw grays, like a new
      bowie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's perhaps the third day when Cherokee begins to struggle into public
      notice. Thar's a felon whose name is Boone, but who calls himse'f the
      'Stingin' Lizard,' an' who's been pesterin' 'round Wolfville, mebby, it's
      a month. This yere Stingin' Lizard is thar when Cherokee comes into camp;
      an' it looks like the Stingin' Lizard takes a notion ag'in Cherokee from
      the jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that this yere Lizard is likely to control public feelin' in the
      matter; none whatever. He's some onpop'lar himself. He's too toomultuous
      for one thing, an' he has a habit of molestin' towerists an' folks he
      don't know at all, which palls on disinterested people who has dooties to
      perform. About once a week this Lizard man goes an' gets the treemers, an'
      then the camp has to set up with him till his visions subsides. Fact is,
      he's what you-alls East calls 'a disturbin' element,' an' we makes ready
      to hang him once or twice, but somethin' comes up an' puts it off, an' we
      sorter neglects it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as I says, he takes a notion ag'in Cherokee. It's the third night
      after Cherokee gets in, an' he's ca'mly behind his box at the Red Light,
      when in peramb'lates this Lizard. Seems like Cherokee, bein' one of them
      quiet wolves, fools up the Lizard a lot. This Lizard's been hostile an'
      blood-hungry all day, an' I reckons he all at once recalls Cherokee; an',
      deemin' of him easy, he allows he'll go an' chew his mane some for
      relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I was low an' ornery like this Lizard, I ain't none shore but I'd be
      fooled them days on Cherokee myse'f. He's been fretful about his whiskey,
      Cherokee has,&mdash;puttin' it up she don't taste right, which not
      onlikely it don't; but beyond pickin' flaws in his nose- paint thar ain't
      much to take hold on about him. He's so slim an' noiseless besides, thar
      ain't none of us but figgers this yere Stingin' Lizard's due to stampede
      him if he tries; which makes what follows all the more impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the Lizard projects along into the Red Light, whoopin' an' carryin' on
      by himse'f. Straightway he goes up ag'inst Cherokee's layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't buy no chips," says the Lizard to Cherokee, as he gets in
      opposite. "I puts money in play; an' when I wins I wants money sim'lar.
      Thar's fifty dollars on the king coppered; an' fifty dollars on the eight
      open. Turn your kyards, an' turn 'em squar'. If you don't, I'll peel the
      ha'r an' hide plumb off the top of your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherokee looks at the Lizard sorter soopercillus an' indifferent; but he
      don't say nothin'. He goes on with the deal, an', the kyards comin' that
      a-way, he takes in the Lizard's two bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Durin' the next deal the Lizard ain't sayin' much direct, but keeps
      cussin' an' wranglin' to himse'f. But he's gettin' his money up all the
      time; an' with the fifty dollars he lose on the turn, he's shy mebby four
      hundred an' fifty at the close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bein' in the hole about five hundred dollars,' says the Lizard, in a
      manner which is a heap onrespectful, ' an' so that a wayfarin' gent may
      not be misled to rooin utter, I now rises to ask what for a limit do you
      put on this deadfall anyhow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The bridle's plumb off to you, amigo,' says Cherokee, an' his tones is
      some hard. I notices it all right enough, 'cause I'm doin' business at the
      table myse'f at the time, an' keepin' likewise case on the game. `The
      bridle's plumb off for you,' says Cherokee, 'so any notion you entertains
      in favor of bankruptin' of yourse'f quick may riot right along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You're dead shore of that?' says the Lizard with a sneer. `Now I reckons
      a thousand-dollar bet would scare this puerile game you deals a-screechin'
      up a tree or into a hole, too easy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`I never likes to see no gent strugglin' in the coils of error,' says
      Cherokee, with a sneer a size larger than the Lizard's; `I don't know what
      wads of wealth them pore old clothes of yours conceals, but jest the same
      I tells you what I'll do. Climb right onto the layout, body, soul, an'
      roll, an' put a figger on your worthless se'f, an' I'll turn you for the
      whole shootin'-match. You're in yere to make things interestin', I sees
      that, an' I'll voylate my business principles an' take a night off to
      entertain you.' An' yere Cherokee lugs out a roll of bills big enough to
      choke a cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I goes you if I lose,' says the Stingin' Lizard. Then assoomin' a
      sooperior air, he remarks: 'Mebby it's a drink back on the trail when I
      has misgivin's as to the rectitood of this yere brace you're dealin'.
      Bein' public-sperited that a-way, in my first frenzy I allows I'll take my
      gun an' abate it a whole lot. But a ca'mer mood comes on, an' I decides,
      as not bein' so likely to disturb a peace- lovin' camp, I removes this
      trap for the onwary by merely bustin' the bank. Thar,' goes on the
      Stingin' Lizard, at the same time dumpin' a large wad on the layout,
      'thar's even four thousand dollars. Roll your game for that jest as it
      lays.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Straighten up your dust,' says Cherokee, his eyes gettin' a kind of
      gleam into 'em, 'straighten up your stuff an' get it some'ers. Don't leave
      it all spraddled over the scene. I turns for it ready enough, but we ain't
      goin' to argue none as to where it lays after the kyard falls.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rest of us who's been buckin' the game moderate an' right cashes in
      at this, an' leaves an onobstructed cloth to the Stingin' Lizard. This
      yere's more caution than good nacher. As long as folks is bettin' along in
      limits, say onder fifty dollars, thar ain't no shootin' likely to ensoo.
      But whenever a game gets immoderate that a-way, an' the limit's off, an'
      things is goin' that locoed they begins to play a thousand an' over on a
      kyard an' scream for action, gents of experience stands ready to go to
      duckin' lead an' dodgin' bullets instanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to resoome: The Stingin' Lizard lines up his stuff, an' the deal
      begins. It ain't thirty seconds till the bank wins, an' the Stingin'
      Lizard is the wrong side of the layout from his money. He takes it onusual
      ugly, only he ain't sayin' much. He sa'nters over to the bar, an' gets a
      big drink. Cherokee is rifflin' the deck, but I notes he's got his gray
      eye on the Stingin' Lizard, an' my respect for him increases rapid. I sees
      he ain't goin' to get the worst of no deal, an' is organized to protect
      his game plumb through if this Lizard makes a break. "'Do you&mdash;all
      know where I hails from?' asks the Stingin' Lizard, comin' back to
      Cherokee after he's done hid his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I shorely don't;' says Cherokee. 'I has from time to time much
      worthless information thrust upon me, but so far I escapes all news of you
      complete.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where I comes from, which is Texas,' says the Lizard, ignorin' of
      Cherokee's manner, the same bein' some insultin', `they teaches the babies
      two things,-never eat your own beef, an' never let no kyard- thief down
      you:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which is highly thrillin',' says Cherokee, 'as reminiscences of your
      yooth, but where does you-all get action on 'em in Arizona?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where I gets action won't be no question long,' says the Lizard, mighty
      truculent. 'I now announces that this yere game is a skin an' a brace.
      Tharfore I returns for my money; an', to be frank, I returns a-shootin':
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's at this p'int we-alls who represents the public kicks back our
      chairs an' stampedes outen range. As the Lizard makes his bluff his hand
      goes to his artillery like a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lizard's some quick, but Cherokee's too soon for him. With the first
      move of the Lizard's hand, he searches out a bowie from som'ers back of
      his neck. I'm some employed placin' myse'f at the time, an' don't decern
      it none till Cherokee brings it over his shoulder like a stream of white
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's shore great knife-work. Cherokee gives the Lizard aige an p'int, an'
      all in one motion. Before the Lizard more'n lifts his weepon, Cherokee
      half slashes his gun-hand off at the wrist; an' then, jest as the Lizard
      begins to wonder at it, he gets the nine- inch blade plumb through his
      neck. He's let out right thar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It looks like I has more of this thing to do,' says Cherokee, an' his
      tone shows he's half-way mournin' over it, ` than any sport in the
      Territory. I tries to keep outen this, but that Lizard gent would have
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the killin', Enright an' Doc Peets, with Boggs, Tutt, an' Jack
      Moore, sorter talks it over quiet, an' allows it's all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This Stingin' Lizard gent,' says Enright, has been projectin' 'round
      lustin' for trouble now, mebby it's six weeks. It's amazin' to me he lasts
      as long as he does, an' it speaks volumes for the forbearin', law-abiding
      temper of the Wolfville public. This Lizard's a mighty oppressive person,
      an' a heap obnoxious; an' while I don't like a knife none myse'f as a
      trail out, an' inclines to distrust a gent who does, I s'pose it's after
      all a heap a matter of taste an' the way your folks brings you up. I leans
      to the view, gents, that this yere corpse is constructed on the squar'.
      What do you-all think, Peets?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I entertains ideas sim'lar,' says Doc Peets. 'Of course I takes it this
      kyard-sharp, Cherokee, aims to bury his dead. He nacherally ain't look.
      in' for the camp to go 'round cleanin' up after him none.' "That's about
      how it stands. Nobody finds fault with Cherokee, an' as he ups an' plants
      the Stingin' Lizard's remainder the next day, makin' the deal with a
      stained box, crape, an' the full regalia, it all leaves the camp with a
      mighty decent impression. By first-drink time in the evenin' of the second
      day, we ain't thinkin' no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you-all begins to marvel where do we get to the hangin' of Cherokee
      Hall? We're workin' in towards it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sees, followin' the Stingin' Lizard's jump into the misty beyond&mdash;which
      it's that sudden I offers two to one them angels notes a look of s'prise
      on the Stingin' Lizard's face as to how he comes to make the trip-Cherokee
      goes on dealin' faro same as usual. As I says before, he ain't no talker,
      nohow; now he says less than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what strikes us as onusual is, he saddles up a pinto pony he's got
      over to the corral, an' jumps off every now an' then for two an' three
      days at a clatter. No one knows where he p'ints to, more'n he says he's
      due over in Tucson. These yere vacations of Cherokee's is all in the month
      after the Stingin' Lizard gets downed. "It's about this time, too, the
      stage gets held up sech a scand'lous number of times it gives people a
      tired feelin'. All by one party, too. He merely prances out in onexpected
      places with a Winchester; stands up the stage in an onconcerned way, an'
      then goes through everythin' an' everybody, from mail-bags to passengers,
      like the grace of heaven through a camp-meetin'. Nacheral, it all creates
      a heap of disgust. "'If this yere industrious hold-up keeps up his lick,'
      says Texas Thompson about the third time the stage gets rustled, `an'
      heads off a few more letters of mine, all I has to say is my wife back in
      Laredo ain't goin' to onderstand it none. She ain't lottin' much on me
      nohow, an' if the correspondence between us gets much more fitful, she's
      goin' p'intin' out for a divorce. This deal's liable to turn a split for
      me in my domestic affairs.' An' that's the way we-alls feels. This stage
      agent is shorely in disrepoot some in Wolfville. If he'd been shakin' up
      Red Dog's letter-bags, we wouldn't have minded so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never does know who's the first to think of Cherokee Hall, but all at
      once it's all over camp Talkin' it over, it's noticed mighty soon that,
      come right to cases, no one knows his record, where he's been or why he's
      yere. Then his stampedin' out of camp like he's been doin' for a month is
      too many for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I puts no trust in them Tucson lies he tells, neither,' says Doc Peets.
      'Whatever would he be shakin' up over in Tucson? His game's yere, an' this
      theery that he's got to go scatterin' over thar once a week is some
      gauzy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever,' says Dan Boggs, who allers trails in after Doc Peets,
      an' plays the same system emphatic. An' I says myse'f, not findin' no
      fault with Boggs tharfor, that this yere Peets is the finest-eddicated an'
      levelest-headed sharp in Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' says Jack Moore, who as I says before does the rope work for the
      Stranglers, 'if you-alls gets it settled that this faro gent's turnin'
      them tricks with the stage an' mail-bags, the sooner he's swingin' to the
      windmill, the sooner we hears from our loved ones at home. What do you
      say, Enright?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why,' says Enright, all thoughtful, 'I reckons it's a case. S'pose you
      caper over where he feeds at the O.K. House an' bring him to us. The signs
      an' signal-smokes shorely p'ints to this yere Cherokee as our meat; but
      these things has to be done in order. Bring him in, Jack, an', to save
      another trip, s'pose you bring a lariat from the corral at the same time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It don't take Moore no time to throw a gun on Cherokee where he's
      consoomin' flapjacks at the O. K. House, an' tell him the committee needs
      him at the New York Store. Cherokee don't buck none, but comes along,
      passive as a tabby cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever's the hock kyard to all this?' he says to Jack Moore. 'Is it
      this Stingin' Lizard play a month ago?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' says Moore, "t'ain't quite sech ancient hist'ry. It's stage
      coaches. Thar's a passel of people down yere as allows you've been
      rustlin' the mails.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Man Rucker, who keeps the O. K. House, is away when Moore rounds up
      his party. But Missis Rucker's thar, an' the way that old lady talks to
      Enright an' the committee is a shame. She comes over to the store, too,
      along of Moore an' Cherokee, an' prances in an' comes mighty near
      stampedin' the whole outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'See yere, Sam Enright,' she shouts, wipin' her hands on her bib, 'what
      be you-alls aimin' for to do? Linin' up, I s'pose to hang the only decent
      man in town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ma'am,' says Enright, 'this yere sharp is 'cused of standin' up the
      stage them times recent over by Tucson. Do you know anythin' about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No; I don't,' says Missis Rucker. 'You don't reckon, now, I did it none,
      do you? I says this, though; it's a heap sight more likely some drunkard
      a-settin' right yere on this committee stops them stages than Cherokee
      Hall.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Woman's nacher's that emotional,' says Enright to the rest of us, 'she's
      oncapable of doin' right. While she's the loveliest of created things,
      still sech is the infirmities of her intellects, that gov'ment would bog
      down in its most important functions, if left to woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bog down or not,' says Missis Rucker, gettin' red an' heated, 'you fools
      settin' up thar like a band of prairie-dogs don't hang this yere Cherokee
      Hall. 'Nother thing, you ain't goin' to hang nobody to the windmill ag'in
      nohow. I has my work to do, an' thar's enough on my hands, feedin' sech
      swine as you-alls three times a day, without havin' to cut down dead folks
      outen my way every time I goes for a bucket of water. You-alls takes
      notice now; you don't hang nothin' to the windmill no more. As for this
      yere Cherokee, he ain't stopped no more stages than I be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But you sees yourse'f, ma'am, you hasn't the slightest evidence tharof,'
      says Enright, tryin' to soothe her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I has, however, what's a mighty sight better than evidence,' says Missis
      Rucker, 'an' that's my firm convictions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, see yere,' says Cherokee, who's been listenin' all peaceful, 'let
      me in on this. What be you-alls doin' this on? I reckons I'm entitled to a
      look at your hand for my money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright goes on an' lays it off for Cherokee; how he's outen camp every
      time the stage is robbed, an' the idee is abroad he does it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As the kyards lay in the box,' says Cherokee, 'I don't reckon thar's
      much doubt but you-alls will wind up the deal by hangin' me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's shorely five to one that a-way,' says Enright. 'Although I'm bound
      to say it ain't none decisive as yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The trooth is,' says Cherokee, sorter thoughtful, 'I wasn't aimin' to be
      hung none this autumn. I ain't got time, gents, for one thing, an' has
      arranged a heap diff'rent. In the next place, I never stands up no stage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's what they all says,' puts in Boggs, who's a mighty impatient man.
      'I shorely notes no reason why we-alls can't proceed with this yere
      lynchin' at once. S'pose this Cherokee ain't stood up no stage; he's done
      plenty of other things as merits death. It strikes me thar's a sight of
      onnecessary talk yere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If you ain't out working the road,' says Doc Peets to Cherokee, not
      heedin' of Bogg's petulance, 'them stage-robbin' times, s'pose you onfolds
      where you was at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, son, not to string this yere story out longer'n three drinks, yere
      is how it is: This Cherokee it looks like is soft-hearted that a-way,&mdash;what
      you calls romantic. An' it seems likewise that shovin' the Stingin' Lizard
      from shore that time sorter takes advantage an' feeds on him. So he goes
      browsin' 'round the postmaster all casooal, an' puts questions. Cherokee
      gets a p'inter about some yearlin' or other in Tucson this Stingin' Lizard
      sends money to an' makes good for, which he finds the same to be fact on
      caperin' over. It's a nephy or some sech play. An' the Stingin' Lizard has
      the young one staked out over thar, an' is puttin' up for his raiment an'
      grub all reg'lar enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I yereafter backs this infant's play myse'f,' says Cherokee to the
      barkeep of the Oriental Saloon over in Tucson, which is the party the
      Stingin' Lizard pastures the young one on. 'You're all right, Bill,' goes
      on this Cherokee to the barkeep,' but now I goes back of the box for this
      infant boy, I reckons I'll saw him off onto a preacher, or some sharp
      sim'lar, where he gets a Christian example. Whatever do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The barkeep says himse'f he allows it's the play to make. So he an'
      Cherokee goes surgin' 'round, an' at last they camps the boy&mdash;who's
      seven years comin' grass&mdash;on the only pulpit-sharp in Tucson. This
      gospel-spreader says he'll feed an' bed down the boy for some sum; which
      was shore a giant one, but the figgers I now forgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherokee gives him a stack of blues to start his game, an' is now
      pesterin' 'round in a co't tryin' to get the young one counter- branded
      from the Stingin' Lizard's outfit into his, an' given the name of Cherokee
      Hall. That's what takes him over to Tucson them times, an' not
      stage-robbin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days later, in fact, to make shore all doubts is over, Cherokee even
      rings in said divine on us; which the divine tells the same story. I don't
      reckon now he's much of a preacher neither; for he gives Wolfville one
      whirl for luck over in the warehouse back of the New York Store, an' I
      shore hears 'em as makes a mighty sight more noise, an' bangs the Bible
      twice as hard, back in the States. I says so to Cherokee; but he puts it
      up he don't bank none on his preachin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What I aims at,' says Cherokee, 'is someone who rides herd on the boy
      all right, an' don't let him stampede off none into vicious ways.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why don't you keep the camp informed of this yere orphan an' the play
      you makes?' says Enright, at the time it's explained to the committee,&mdash;the
      time they trees Cherokee about them stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's that benev'lent an' mushy,' says Cherokee, 'I'm plumb ashamed of
      the deal, an' don't allow to go postin' no notices tharof. But along comes
      this yere hold-up business, an', all inadvertent, tips my hand; which the
      same I stands, however, jest the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's all right,' says Enright, some disgusted though; 'but the next time
      you makes them foundlin' asylum trips, don't walk in the water so much.
      Leave your trail so Wolfville sees it, an' then folks ain't so likely to
      jump your camp in the dark an' take to shootin' you up for Injuns an'
      sim'lar hostiles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But one thing more,' continues Enright, an' then we orders the drinks.
      Jack Moore is yereby instructed to present the compliments of the
      committee to Rucker, when he trails in from Tucson; which he also notifies
      him to hobble his wife yereafter durin' sessions of this body. She's not
      to go draggin' her lariat 'round loose no more, settin' law an' order at
      defiance durin' sech hours as is given to business by the Stranglers."

      CHAPTER III. THE STORY OF WILKINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      "No; I don't reckon I ever cuts the trail of this yere Wilson you
      mentions, once. If I does, the fact's done pulled its picket-pin an'
      strayed from my recollections."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had recalled the name of a former friend, one Wilson, who, sore given to
      liquor, had drifted to Arizona many years before and disappeared.
      Suggesting "Wilson" to the Old Cattleman, I asked if he had met with such
      a name and character in his Wolfville rambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As often chanced, however, the question bore fruit in a story. It
      frequently needed but a slight blow from the rod of casual inquiry, and
      the fountains of my old friend's reminiscences gushed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never crosses up with him," observed the old Cattleman; "but
      speakin' of Wilson puts in my mind a gent by the name of Wilkins, who it's
      some likely is as disrepootable as your old pard Wilson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Wilkins?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' thrillin', "answered the old gentleman; "nothin' you'd stay up
      nights to hear, I don't reckon. It's Wilkins's daughter who is the only
      redeemin' thing about the old Cimmaron; an' it's a heap likely right now
      it's her I remembers about instead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," he continued, "I don't mind onfoldin' as to Wilkins, nor yet
      of an' concernin' his daughter. You see this Wilkins is herdin' 'round
      Wolfville when I first trails in. I never does know where he hails from. I
      don't reckon' though, he ever grades no ways high, an' at the crisis I'm
      mentionin' his speshul play is gettin' drunk mostly; an' not allowin' to
      hurt himse'f none with work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Workin' with your fins,' says this Wilkins, 'is low an' onendoorin' to a
      gent with pride to wound. It ain't no use neither. I knows folks as works,
      an' folks as don't, an' you can't tell one from which. They gets along
      entirely sim'lar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But how you goin' to live?' says Dave Tutt, when he makes this remark,
      an' who is fussin' with Wilkins for bein' so reedic'lous an' shiftless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all right about my livin',' says Wilkins; 'don't you-all pass no
      restless nights on my account. Go read your Scriptures; read that bluff
      about feedin' the young ravens an' sparrers. Well, that's me this trip.
      I'm goin' to rap for a show-down on them promises an' see what's in 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This camp ain't strong on Holy Writ, nohow,' says Dave Tutt, 'an' I'm
      partic'lar puny that a-way. It's your game though, an' your American
      jedgement goes soopreme as to how you plays it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Wilkins lives in a wickeyup out on the aige of the town, an' a girl,
      which she's his daughter, about 19 years old, keeps camp for him. No one
      knows her well. She stays on her reservation mighty close, an' never seems
      visible much. I notices her in the New York Store once, buyin' some salt
      hoss, an'she ain't no dream of loveliness neither as to looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her face makes you feel she's good people though, with her big soft eyes.
      They has a tired, broke-down look, like somehow she's been packed more'n
      she can carry, an' has two or three notions about layin' down with the
      load.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mebby two weeks after Dave Tutt's talk with Wilkins, when we're all
      in the Red Light takin' our forty drops, an' Sam Enright brings up this
      yere Wilkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It has been a question with me,' he says, 'how this old shorthorn and
      his girl manages for to make out; an' while I care none whatever for
      Wilkins, it ain't no credit to a live camp like this to permit a young
      female to suffer, an' I pauses yere to add, it ain't goin' to occur no
      more. Yesterday, allowin' to bushwhack some trooth about 'em, I waits till
      old Wilkins drifts over to the corral, an' then I goes projectin' 'round
      for facts. I works it plenty cunnin', an' sorter happens up to the old
      man's tepee. I calls the girl out an' puts it up I wants to see her paw a
      heap on some business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"I wants to see him speshul,"' I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Well, he ain't here now,"' says the girl, "so whatever'll you do?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"I don't reckon you could prance 'round some an' find him for me, could
      you, Miss?"' I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'So the girl,' continues Enright, 'which her name is Susan, puts on her
      shaker an' goes stampedin' off; an' while she's gone I injuns an' spies
      'round a whole lot; an', comin' down to the turn, Wilkins an' that girl
      ain't got nothin' to eat. The question now is, what action does Wolfville
      'naugerate at a juncture sech as this?' "'What's the matter with takin' up
      a donation like they does for a preacher, an' saw it onto the girl?' says
      Dan Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You couldn't open your game that a-way, nohow,' says Doc Peets. 'That's
      accordin' to Hoyle for sky-pilots an' missionary people; but a young
      female a-hoidin' of herse'f high spurns your money. Thar's nothin' ketches
      me like a female of my species in distress, an' I recalls offerin' to
      stake a lady, who's lost her money somehow, back in St. Looey once. This
      yere female was strange to me entire, but if she'd knowed me from 'way
      back she couldn't a-blazed up more frightful. The minute I pulls my
      bankroll on her, she goes cavortin' off too hostile to talk. It takes ten
      minutes to get her back to the agency to hear me 'pologize, an' even then
      she glares an' snorts like she's liable to stampede ag'in. No; you don't
      want to try an' give this girl no money. What we-alls needs is to hunt up
      somethin' for her to work at an' pay her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Doc's right,' says Enright, 'an' the thing is to find somethin' for
      this yere lady to do. Any gent with a notion on the subject can't speak
      too quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No party need take my remarks as personal,' says Burns, who runs the Red
      Light, 'as nothin' invidjous is intended; but I rises to say that a heap
      of my business is on credit. A gent comes in free an' sociable, names his
      sozodont, an' gets it. If he pays cash, all right; if he wants credit, all
      right. "You names your day to drink, an' you names your day to pay," is my
      motto, as you-alls knows. This bein' troo, onder present exigences what
      for a scheme would it be for me to get an outfit of books,&mdash;day-books,
      week-books, ledgers, an' the rest of the layout,&mdash;an' let this yere
      maiden keep 'em a whole lot? I throws this out as a su'gestion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I ain't meanin' nothin' ag'inst Burns's su'gestion,' says Texas
      Thompson, 'but in my opinion this camp ain't ripe for keepin' books as
      yet. Things like that has to be come to by degrees. I've knowed a heap of
      trouble arise from keepin' books, an' as long as this yere's a peaceful
      camp let's keep it that a-way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That settles it,' says Burns, 'thar's enough said, an' I don't keep no
      books.'

      "'You-alls present knows me,' says Cherokee Hall, who, as I says previous,
      is turnin' faro in the Red Light, 'an' most of you has met me frequent in
      a business way. Thar's my game goin' every night reg'lar. Thar's nothin'
      tin-horn about it. It ain't no skin game neither. Any gent with doubts can
      step over an' test my box, which he'll find all comfortable on the layout
      awaitin' his convenience. It ain't been usual for me to blow my own bazoo
      to any extent, an' I only does it now as bein' preliminary to the
      statement that my game ain't no deadfall, an' is one as a respectable an'
      virchus female person could set in on with perfect safetytood to her
      reputation. This yere lady in question needs light, reg'lar employment,
      an' I lets it fly that if she wants in on any sech deal I'll go her a blue
      stack a week to hold down the chair as look-out for my game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cherokee's offer is all right,' says Enright; 'it's good talk from a
      squar' man. Women, however, is partic'lar, an' like hosses they shies at
      things thar ain't no danger in. You sees how that is; a woman don't reason
      nothin', she feels an' mighty likely this young person is loaded to the
      gyards with sech notions ag'in gamblin' as would send her flyin' at the
      bare mention. The fact is, I thinks of somethin' sim'lar, but has to give
      it up. I figgers, first dash out o' the box, that a safe, easy trail to
      high ground is to give her a table an' let her deal a little stud for the
      boys. This yere wouldn't be no resk, an' the rake is a shore thing for
      nine or ten dollars a night. Bein' a benev'lence, I knows the boys would
      set in mighty free, an' the trouble would be corraled right thar. With
      this yere in my mind I taps her gently about our various games when I
      calls for her paw; an' to put it straight, she takes it reluctant an'
      disgusted at the mere hint. Of course we-alls has to stand these things
      from woman, an' we might as well p'int up some other way an' no time
      lost.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't you-alls reckon for to make a speshul rake on all poker goin',
      same as about that Yallerhouse gent, might be an ondefeasible way to get
      at the neck of this business?' says Dave Tutt. 'I merely asks it as a
      question.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That wouldn't do,' says Doc Peets, 'but anyhow yere comes Wilkins how,
      an' if, as Enright says, the're out of chuck up his way, I reckons I'll
      lose a small bet to the old shorthorn ontil sech times as we devises some
      scheme all reg'lar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Howdy, Wilkins?' says Doc, mighty gay an' genial, 'how's things stackin'
      up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mighty ornery,' says Wilkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Feel like makin' a little wager this A. M.?' says Doc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you-all want to gamble at?' says Wilkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh,' says Doc, 'I'm feelin' a heap careless about what I do gamble at.
      S'pose I goes you ten dollars's worth of grub the Lordsburg buckboard
      don't show up none to-day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If I had ten dollars I'd about call you a lot on that,' says Wilkins,
      'but I'm a pore cuss an' ain't got no ten dollars, an' what's the use?
      None of you-alls ain't got no Red Light whiskey- chips you ain't usin', be
      you? S'pose you-alls gropes about in your war-bags an' sees. I'm needin'
      of a drink mighty bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Wilkins looks some queer about the eyes, an' more'n usual shaky, so
      we gives him a big drink an' he sorter braces up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'll back Wilkins's end of that bet you offers, Doc,' says Tutt, 'so
      consider it made, will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You was offerin' to bet grub,' says the old man, powerful peevish an'
      fretful. 'What for do you want to bet grub? Why don't you bet money, so I
      gets what I wants with it? It's my money when I wins. Mebby I don't want
      no grub. Mebby I wants clothes or whiskey. You ain't no sport, Doc, to tie
      up a play with a string like that. Gimme another drink some one, I'm most
      dyin' for some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man 'pears like he's mighty sick that a-way, so thar's nothin'
      for it but to give him another hooker, which we does accordin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm feelin' like I was shot hard by somethin',' he says, 'an' I don't
      like for to go home till I'm better, an' scare Sue. I reckon I'll camp
      down on this yere monte table for an hour till I comes 'round.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Wilkins curls up on the table, an' no one notices him for about twenty
      minutes, when along comes rattlin' up the Lordsburg mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You win, Wilkins,' says Peets; 'come over to the New York Store an' cut
      out your stuff.' "The old man acts like he don't hear, so Doc shakes him
      up some. No use, thar ain't no get up in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Looks like he's gone to sleep for good,' says Doc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he walks 'round him, shakes him, an' takes a look at his eye,
      a-openin' of it with his finger. Finally he stands back, sticks his thumb
      in his belt, an' whistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's up?' says Cherokee Hall. 'He ain't tryin' to work us for another
      drink I hopes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, this is a deal,' says Doc, 'an' no humbug neither. Gents, I'm
      blessed if this yere old prairie-dog ain't shorely up an' died.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls comes up an' takes a look at him, an' Doc has called the turn.
      Shore enough the old man has cashed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`This is a hoss on us, an' no doubt about it,' says Enright. 'I ain't
      worryin' for Wilkins, as he most likely is ahead on the deal; but what
      gets me is how to break the news to this yere maiden. It's goin' to be a
      hair-line play. I reckons, Doc, it's you an' me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they goes over to Wilkins's wickeyup an' calls the young Sue girl out,
      an' Enright begins tellin' her mighty soft as how her paw is took bad down
      to the Red Light. But the girl seems to get it as right as if she's
      scouted for it a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He's dead!' she says; an' then cripples down alongside of the door an'
      begins to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar ain't no use denyin' it, Miss,' says Enright, 'your paw struck in
      on the big trail where the hoof-prints all p'ints one way. But don't take
      it hard, Miss, thar ain't a gent don't give you sympathy. What you do now
      is stay right yere, an' the camp'll tend to the funeral, an' put it up
      right an' jest as you says, you bein' mourner-in-chief. You can trust us
      for the proper play; since we buries Jack King, obsequies is our long
      suit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little Sue girl struggles through somehow, an' has her nerve with
      her. The funeral, you bet, is right. This time we ropes in a preacher
      belongin' to some deep-water outfit over in Tucson. He somehow is strayed,
      an' happens along our way, an' we gets him squar' in the door. He jumps in
      an' gives them ceremonies a scientific whirl as ain't possible nohow to
      amatures. All 'round we wouldn't have put on more dog if we'd been
      plantin' Enright; all of course on the little Sue girl's account. Next day
      the outfit goes over to find out whatever she allows to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You sees, Miss; says Enright, 'anythin' you says, goes. Not waitin' to
      learn its name, even, I'm directed to state as how the camp backs your
      play an' makes good.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm allowin' to go to the States,' says the girl, 'an' I'm obleeged to
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We was hopin',' says Enright, 'as you'd stay yere. We-alls sorter
      figgers you'd teach us a school. Of course thar ain't no papooses yet, but
      as a forced play we arranges to borrow a small herd from Tombstone, an'
      can do it too easy. Then, ag'in, a night-school would hit our needs right;
      say one night a week. Thar's a heap of ignorance in this yere camp, an' we
      needs a night-school bad. It would win for fifty dollars a week, Miss; an'
      you thinks of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the pore girl couldn't think of it nohow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Of course, Miss, says Enright, 'we alls ain't expectin' you to open this
      yere academy the first kyards off the deck. You needs time to line up your
      affairs, an' am likewise wrung with grief. You takes your leesure as to
      that; meanwhile of course your stipend goes on from now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the little Sue girl couldn't listen. Her paw is dead, an' now she's
      due in the States. She says things is all right thar. She has friends as
      her paw never likes; but who's friends of hers, an' she'll go to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, Miss,' says Enright, mighty regretful, 'if that's how it lays, I
      reckons you'll go, so thar's nothin' for us to do but settle up an' fork
      over some dust we owes your paw. He bein' now deceased, of course you
      represents.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl couldn't see how any one owes her paw, ''cause he's been too
      sick to work,' she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We owes him all the same,' says Enright, mighty ferocious. 'We
      onderstands well enough how we comes to owe him, don't we, Doc?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You can stack in your life we do,' says Doc, plenty prompt an' cheerful.
      'We-alls owes for his nailin' them hoss-thiefs when they tries to clean
      out the corral.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's it,' says Enright, 'for ketchin' of some rustlers who lays for
      our stock. It's all right, Miss; you needn't look so doubtful. You
      wouldn't if you knowed this camp. It's the last outfit on earth as would
      go an' give money to people. It's a good straight camp, Wolfville is; but
      business is business, an' we ain't pirootin' 'round none, givin' nothin'
      away, be we, Doc?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not much,' says Doc. 'It's enough for a gent to pay debts, without
      stampedin' 'round makin' presents of things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever,' says Enright; 'so Miss, me an Doc'll vamos over to the
      Red Light an' get the dust, an' I reckons we'll be back in an hour. I
      s'pose we owes Mister Wilkins about 'five hundred dollars, don't we, Doc?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tain't so much,' says Doc, who's guileful that a-way. As he sees the
      little Sue girl archin' for another buck, he pulls out a paper an' makes a
      bluff. 'Yere it is,&mdash;four hundred an' ninety-three dollars an'
      seventy-four cents. I puts it down all accurate, 'cause I don't allow no
      sharp to come 'round an' beat me none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls throws 'round an' makes up the pot to come to Doc's figger-
      -which I wants to say right yere, Doc Peets is the ablest gent I ever sees&mdash;an'
      the little Sue girl has to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which this money lets her out right, an' she cries an' thanks us, an' the
      next day she takes the stage for Tucson. We're thar to say 'good-by' an'
      wish the little Sue girl luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Adios,' says Peets, takin' off his hat to her; 'it ain't down on the
      bills none, but if you-all could manage to kiss this yere outfit once
      apiece, Miss, it would be regarded. You needn't be afraid. Some of 'em
      looks a little off, but they're all right, an' b'ar huggin' is barred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the little Sue girl begins with Enright an' kisses us all, a- sobbin'
      meantime some free. As the affection proceeds, Cherokee sorter shoves back
      an' allows he'll pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not any pass!' says Enright. 'Any gent who throws off on that thar
      little Sue girl, she willin', needn't look for any luck but lynchin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That settles it,' says Cherokee, 'I saloots this yere lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he ups an' kisses the little Sue girl like she's a hot flat- iron, an'
      backs into the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cherokee makes me tired,' says Peets, who's ridin' herd on the play.
      When it comes his turn he kisses her slow an' rapturous, an' is
      contemptuous of Cherokee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When she's in the stage a-startin', Cherokee walks up, all respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You've been away from the States some time, Miss,' he says, 'an' it's an
      even break you won't find things the way you expects. Now, you remember,
      shore; whatever game's bein' turned back thar, if it goes ag'in you, raise
      the long yell for a sharp called Cherokee Hall; an' his bank's yours to go
      behind your play.'"

      CHAPTER IV. THE WASHWOMAN'S WAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was evening. The first dark foreshadowing of the coming night clothed
      all in half obscurity. But I knew the way; I could have travelled the
      little path at midnight. There he was, the Old Cattleman, under a favorite
      tree, the better to avoid the heavy dew. He sat motionless and seemed to
      be soaking himself, as one might say, in the balmy weather of that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wisdom had ordered Jim, my black man, to attend my steps. The laconic,
      half-sad salutation of my old friend at once gave Black Jim a mission. He
      was dispatched in quest of stimulants. After certain exact and almost
      elaborate commands to Black Jim, and that useful African's departure, I
      gently probed my companion with a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thar's nothin' the matter of me; sorter pensive, that's all," was my
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman appeared silent and out of sorts. Following the coming
      of Black Jim, however, who brought a lusty toddy, he yielded to a better
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It simply means I'm gettin' old; my settin' 'round balky this a- way.
      Thar's some seventy wrinkles on my horns; nothin' young or recent about
      that. Which now it often happens to me, like it does to old folks general,
      that jest when it begins to grow night, I gets moody an' bad. Looks like
      my thoughts has been out on some mental feed-ground all day, an' they
      comes stringin' in like cattle to get bedded down for the night. Nacheral,
      I s'pose they sorter mills an' stands 'round oneasy like for a while
      before they lies down all comfortable. Old people partic'lar gets
      dissatisfied. If they's single-footers like me an' ain't wedded none;
      campin' 'round at taverns an' findin' of 'em mockeries; they wishes they
      has a wife a whole lot. If they be, they wish she'd go visit her folks.
      Gettin' old that a-way an' lonely makes folks frequent mighty contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, as I imparts to you yeretofore,&mdash;mebby it's a month,&mdash;I
      never marries nothin'. I reckons too, I'm in love one round-up an' another
      mighty near a dozen times. But somehow I allers lose the trail an' never
      does run up with none of 'em once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down in the Brazos country thar was a little blue-eyed girl,&mdash;back
      forty years it is,&mdash;an' the way I adores her plumb tires people. I
      reckons I ropes at her more'n fifty times, but I never could fasten. Thar
      comes a time when it looks powerful like I'm goin' to run my brand onto
      her; but she learns that Bill Jenks marks 150 calves the last spring
      round-up, an' me only forty, an' that settles it; she takes Jenks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's astonishin' how little I deems of this yere maiden after Bill gets
      her. Two months before, I'd rode my pony to death to look once in her
      eyes. She's like sunshine in the woods to me, an' I dotes on every word
      she utters like it's a roast apple. But after she gets to be Bill's wife I
      cools complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that lovin' Bill's wife, with his genius for shootin' a pistol, is
      goin' to prove a picnic,&mdash;an' him sorter peevish an' hostile
      nacheral. But lettin' that go in the discard, I shore don't care nothin'
      about her nohow when she's Bill's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recalls that prior to them nuptials with Bill I gets that locoed lovin'
      this girl I goes bulgin' out to make some poetry over her. I compiles one
      stanza; an' I'm yere to remark it's harder work than a June day in a
      brandin' pen. Ropin' an' flankin' calves an' standin' off an old cow with
      one hand while you irons up her offspring with t'other, from sun-up till
      dark, is sedentary compared to makin' stanzas. What was the on I makes?
      Well, you can bet a hoss I ain't forgot it none.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A beautiful woman is shorely a moon, The nights of your life to
      illoomine; She's all that is graceful, guileful an' soon, Is woman, lovely
      woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm plumb tangled up in my rope when I gets this far, an' I takes a
      lay-off. Before I gathers strength to tackle it ag'in, Jenks gets her; so
      bein' thar's no longer nothin' tharin I never makes a finish. I allers
      allowed it would have been a powerful good poem if I'd stampeded along
      cl'ar through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, son; women that a-way is shorely rangy cattle an' allers on the
      move. Thar's a time once when two of 'em comes mighty near splittin'
      Wolfville wide open an' leavin' it on both sides of the trail. All that
      ever saves the day is the ca'm jedgement an' promptitood of Old Man
      Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is how Wolfville walks into this petticoat ambush. The camp is
      gettin' along all peaceful an' serene an' man-fashion. Thar's the
      post-office for our letters; thar's the Red Light for our bug-juice;
      thar's the O. K. Restauraw for our grub; an' thar's the stage an' our
      ponies to pull our freight with when Wolfville life begins to pull on us
      as too pastoral, an' we thirsts for the meetropolitan gayety of Tucson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I says we alls has all that heart can hunger for; that is hunger on
      the squar'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among other things, thar's a Chink runnin' a laundry an' a-doin' of our
      washin'. This yere tub-trundler's name is Lung, which, however. brands no
      cattle yere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's one afternoon when Doc Peets gets a letter from a barkeep over
    </p>
    <p>
      in Tucson sayin': Dear Doc:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thar's an esteemable lady due in Wolfville on to-morrer's stage. She's
      p'intin' out to run a laundry. Please back her play. If thar's a Chinaman
      in town, run him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And obleege, yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever do you think, Enright?' says Doc Peets after readin' us the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all right,' says Enright, 'the Chink goes. It's onbecomin' as a
      spectacle for a Caucasian woman of full blood to be contendin' for foul
      shirts with a slothful Mongol. Wolfville permits no sech debasin'
      exhibitions, an' Lung must vamos. Jack,' he says, turnin' to Jack Moore,
      'take your gun an' sa'nter over an' stampede this yere opium-slave. Tell
      him if he's visible to the naked eye in the scenery yere-abouts to-morrow
      when this lady jumps into camp, he's shore asked the price of soap the
      last time he ever will in this vale of tears.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's the matter of lynchin' this yere Chink?' says Dan Boggs. 'The
      camp's deadly dull, an' it would cheer up things a whole lot, besides
      bein' compliments to this young female Old Monte's bringin' in on the
      stage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh no,' says Enright, 'no need of stringin him none. On second thought,
      Jack, I don't reckon I'd run him out neither. It dignifies him too much.
      S'pose you canter up to his tub-camp an' bring him over, an' we'll reveal
      this upheaval in his shirt-burnin' destinies by word of mouth. If he grows
      reluctant jest rope him 'round the neck with his queue, an' yank him. It
      impresses 'em an' shows 'em they're up ag'in the law. I s'pose, Peets, I
      voices your sentiments in this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shore,'" says Doc Peets&mdash;which this Peets is the finest-eddicated
      man I ever meets. 'This Chinaman must pull his freight. We-alls owes it
      not only to this Tucson lady, but to the lovely sex she represents. Woman,
      woman, what has she not done for man! As Johanna of Arc she frees the
      sensuous vine-clad hills of far-off Switzerland. As Grace Darling she
      smooths the fever-heated pillow of the Crimea. In reecompense she asks one
      little, puny boon&mdash;to fire from our midst a heathen from the Orient.
      Gents, thar's but one answer: We plays the return game with woman. This
      Chinaman must go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Jack comes back with Lung, which he does prompt, Enright starts in
      to deal the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It ain't no use, Lung,' says Enright, 'tryin' to explain to you- all
      what's up. Your weak Asiatic intellect couldn't get the drop onto it
      no-how. You've been brought to a show-down ag'in a woman, an' you're
      out-held. You've got to quit; savey? Don't let us find you yere to-morrow.
      By third-drink time we'll be a-scoutin' for you with somethin' besides an
      op'ry glass, an' if you're noticed as part of the landscape you're goin'
      to have a heap of bad luck. I'd advise you to p'int for Red Dog, but as to
      that you plays your hand yourse'f."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next day that old drunkard Monte comes swingin' in with the stage; the
      six hosses on the jump, same as he allers does with a woman along. Over at
      the post-office, where he stops, a lady gets out, an' of course we-alls
      bows p'lite an' hopes she's well an' frisky. She allows she is, an' heads
      for the O. K. House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It floats over pretty soon that her name's Annie, an' as none of us wants
      to call her jest 'Annie'&mdash;the same bein' too free a play&mdash;an'
      hearin' she lives a year or two at Benson, we concloods to call her Benson
      Annie, an' let it go at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The same bein' musical an' expressive,' says Doc Peets, as we all lines
      up ag'in the Red Light bar, 'I su'gests we baptize this lady "Benson
      Annie," an' yere's to her success.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we-alls turns up our glasses, an' Benson Annie it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day the fetid Lung is a thing of the past, an' Benson Annie has
      the game to herse'f. Two days later she raises the tariff to fifty cents
      on shirts, instead of twenty-five, as previous with the Chink. But no one
      renigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A gent,' says Doc Peets, 'as holds that a Caucasian woman is goin' to
      wash a shirt for the miserable stipend of a slave of the Orient must be
      plumb locoed. Wolfville pays fifty cents for shirts an' is proud tharof.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things goes along for mighty like a month, an' then this yere Benson
      Annie allows she'll have a visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm plumb, clean sick,' she says, 'of seein' nothin' but a lot of
      drunken, good-for-nothin' sots a-pesterin' 'round, an' I done reckons I'll
      have my friend Sal come over from Tombstone an' see me a whole lot. It'll
      be some relaxation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mebby it's four days after when this yere Sal hops outen the stage, an'
      for the next week thar ain't no washin' done whatever, while Benson Annie
      an' Sal works the wire aige offen their visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`A gent as would begretch two pore, hard-workin' girls a lay-off of a
      week,' says Enright, 'ain't clean strain, an' I don't want to know sech a
      hoss-thief nohow'; an' we-alls feels likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But slap on the heels of all this yere gregar'ousness on the part of
      Benson Annie an' Sal, the deal begins to come queer. At the end of the
      week the two girls has a row, an' in the turn Sal goes to t'other end of
      camp an' opens a laundry. That does settle it. Benson Annie gives Sal
      fits, an' Sal shorely sends 'em back. Then they quits speakin', an when
      they meets on the street they concocts snoots at each other. This scares
      Enright, but he does his level best an' tries to keep the boys from takin'
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In a play like this yere,' he says, 'this camp don't take no kyards. For
      the first time Wolfville passes out, an' offers to make it a jack'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as one day an' the next trails by, the boys sorter gets lined up one
      way an' t'other; some for Benson Annie an' some for Sal, an' things is
      shorely gettin' hot. Hamilton, over at the dance-hall, ups an' names his
      place the 'Sal Saloon,' an' Burns takes down the sign on the Red Light an'
      calls it the 'Benson Annie House.' Finally things sorter culminates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan Boggs, who's a open, voylent Annie man, comes a-prancin' into the Red
      Light one night, an' after stampin' an' rappin' his horns 'round a whole
      lot, allows his shirt is cleaner than Dave Tutt's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tutt says he don't care nothin' for himse'f, an' none whatever for the
      shirt; an' while he an' Dan's allers been friends an' crossed the plains
      together, still he don't allow he'll stand 'round much an' see a pore
      ondefended female, like Sal, maligned. So Tutt outs with his gun an' gets
      Boggs in the laig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere brings things down to cases. Enright is worried sick at it. But
      he's been thinkin' mighty arduous for quite a spell, an' when Boggs gets
      creased, he sees somethin' must be done, an' begins to line himse'f for a
      play for out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the next day after Boggs gets ag'in Tutt, an' Doc Peets has plugged
      up the hole, when Enright rounds up the whole passel of us in the Red
      Light. He looks that dignified an' what you-alls calls impressive, that
      the barkeep, yieldin' to the gravity of the situation, allows the drinks
      is on the house. We-alls gets our forty drops, an' sorter stands pat
      tharon in silence, waitin' for Enright to onfold his game. We shore knows
      if thar's a trail he'll find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I Gents,' he says at last,&mdash;an' it seems like he's sorry an' hurt
      that a-way,&mdash;'I'll not drift into them harrowin' differences which
      has rent asunder what was aforetimes the peacefullest camp in Arizona. I
      wants you-alls, however, to take note of my remarks, for what I says is
      shorely goin' to go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yere Enright pauses to take a small drink by himse'f, while we-alls
      tarries about, some oneasy an' anxious as to what kyards falls next. At
      last Enright p'ints out on the trail of his remarks ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is with pain an' mortification,' he says&mdash;an' yere he fixes his
      eye some hard an' delib'rate on a young tenderfoot named French, who's
      been lost from the States somethin' like six months&mdash;'it is with pain
      an' mortification, I says, that I notes for a week past our young friend
      an' townsman, Willyum French, payin' marked an' ondiscreet attentions to
      Benson Annie, a female person whom we all respects. At all times, day an'
      night, when he could escape his dooties as book-keep for the stage
      company, he has pitched camp in her s'ciety. Wolfville has been shocked,
      an' a pure lady compromised. Standin' as we-alls does in the light of a
      parent to this pore young female, we have determined the wrong must be
      made right, an' Mister French must marry the girl. I have submitted these
      yere views to Benson Annie, an' she concurs. I've took the trouble to
      bring a gospel-sharp over from Tucson to do the marryin', an' I've set the
      happy event for to-night, to conclood with a blow-out in the dance-hall at
      my expense. We will, of course, yereby lose Benson Annie in them
      industrial walks she now adorns, for I pauses to give Mister French a
      p'inter; the sentiments of this camp is ag'in a married female takin' in
      washin'. Not to play it too low down on Mister French, who, while
      performin' a private dooty, is also workin' for a public good, I heads a
      subscription with fifty dollars for a present for the bride. I'd say in
      closin' that if I was Mister French I wouldn't care to object to this
      union. The lady is good-lookin', the subscription is cash, an' in the
      present heated condition of the public mind, an' with the heart of the
      camp set on this weddin', I wouldn't be responsible if he does. Now,
      gents, who'll follow my fifty dollars with fifty more? Barkeep, do your
      dooty while the subscription-paper goes 'round.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The biddin' is mighty lively, an' in ten minutes seven hundred dollars is
      raised for a dowry. Then French, who has been settin' in a sort of daze,
      gets up:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mister Enright an' gents,' he says, `this yere is a s'prise-party to me,
      but it goes. It's a hoss on me, but I stands it. I sees how it is, an' as
      a forced play I marries Benson Annie in the interests of peace. Which the
      same bein' settled, if Benson Annie is yere, whirl her up an' I'll come
      flutterin' from my perch like a pan of milk from a top shelf, an' put an
      end to this onhealthful excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls applauds French an' is proud to note he's game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`An' to be free an' open with you, French,' says Texas Thompson, so as to
      make him feel he's ahead on the deal; which he shore is, for this yere
      Benson Annie is corn-fed, 'if it ain't for a high-sperited lady back in
      Laredo who relies on me, I'd be playin' your hand myse'f.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no one delays the game. Enright brings over Benson Annie, who's
      blushin' some, but ain't holdin' back; an' she an' French fronts up for
      business. This yere preacher-sharp Enright's roped up is jest shufflin'
      for the deal, when, whatever do you reckon takes place? I'm a Mexican if
      this yere Sal don't come wanderin' in, a- cryin' an' a-mournin' powerful.
      She allows with sobs if her dear friend Annie's goin' to get married she
      wants in on the game as bridesmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which you-all shorely gets a hand as sech,' says Doc Peets, who's actin'
      lookout for the deal; an' so he stakes out Sal over by the nigh side of
      Benson Annie, who kisses her quite frantic, an' unites her wails to Sal's.
      Both of 'em weepin' that a-way shorely makes the occasion mighty
      sympathetic an' damp. But Peets says it's the reg'lar caper, an' you can
      gamble Peets knows. "'Thar,' says Enright, when the last kyard's out an'
      the French fam'ly is receivin' congratulations, 'I reckons that now, with
      only one laundry, Wolfville sees a season of peace. It's all right, but
      I'm yere to remark that the next lady as dazzles this camp with her
      deebut, an' onfurls a purpose to plunge into work, ain't goin' to keep a
      laundry none. Gents, the bridle's plumb off the hoss. We'll now repair to
      the dance-hall, if so be meets your tastes, an' take the first steps in a
      debauch from which, when it's over, this yere camp of Wolfville dates
      time.'"

      CHAPTER V. ENRIGHT'S PARD, JIM WILLIS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "If my mem'ry's dealin' a squar' game," remarked the Old Cattleman, as he
      moved his chair a bit more into the shade, "it's some'ers over in the
      foot-hills of, the Floridas when Enright vouchsafes why he hates
      Mexicans."
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was drowsy. Conversation between us had in a sleepy way ranged
      a wide field. As had grown to be our habit we at last settled on Wolfville
      and its volatile inhabitants. I asked to be enlightened as to the sage
      Enright, and was informed that, aside from his courage and love of strict
      justice, the prominent characteristic of our Wolfville Lycurgus was his
      wrath against Mexicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that Enright loathes so much as he deplores 'em, "continued the old
      gentleman. "However, I don't aim to be held as sayin' he indorses their
      existence a little bit; none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright's tellin' of this tale arises outen a trivial incident which a
      Mexican is the marrow of. We're out on the spring round-up, an' combin'
      the draws an' dry ARROYAS over between the cow springs an' the Floridas,
      when one night a Mexican runs off a passel of our ponies. The hoss-hustler
      is asleep, I reckons, at the time this Mexican stacks in. He says himse'f
      he's lyin' along the back of his bronco gazin' at the stars when this
      robber jumps at the ponies an' flaps a blanket or somethin', an' away
      patters every hoof in the band.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere Mexican don't run off with only about a handful; I takes it he
      can't round up no more in the dark. When you-all stampedes a bunch of
      ponies that a-way they don't hold together like cattle, but plunges off
      diffusive. It's every bronco for himse'f, disdainful of all else, an' when
      it's sun-up you finds 'em spattered all over the scene an' not regardin'
      of each other much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this yere Mexican, after he stampedes 'em, huddles what he can
      together&mdash;as I says mebby it's a dozen&mdash;an' p'ints off into the
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it ain't no time after the sun shows the tracks when Enright,
      Jack Moore, an' myse'f is on the trail. Tutt an' Dan Boggs wants in on the
      play, but we can't spar' so many from the round-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's one of the stolen ponies tips this Greaser's hand. It's the second
      day, an' we-alls loses the trail for mebby it's fifteen minutes. We're
      smellin' along a canyon to find it ag'in, when from over a p'int of rocks
      we hears a bronco nicker. He gets the scent of an acquaintance which
      Moore's ridin' on, an' says 'How!' pony- fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's no need goin' into wearyin' details. Followin' the nicker we comes
      surgin' in on our prey, an' it's over in a minute. Thar's two Mexicans,&mdash;our
      criminal trackin' up with a pard that mornin'. But of course we-alls knows
      he's thar long hours back by the tracks, so it ain't no s'prise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere second Mexican is downed on the run-in. He shows a heap of
      interest in our comin', an' takes to shootin' us up mighty vivid with a
      Winchester at the time; an' so Enright, who's close in, jumps some lead
      into him an' stretches him. He don't manage to do no harm, nohow, more'n
      he creases my hoss a little. However, as this yere hoss is amazin'
      low-sperited, an' as bein' burnt that a-way with a bullet sorter livens
      him up a heap, I don't complain none. Still Enright's all-wise enough to
      copper the Greaser, for thar ain't no sayin' what luck the felon has with
      that little old gun of his if he keeps on shootin'. Which, as I observes,
      Enright downs him, an' his powder-burnin' an' hoss-rustlin' stops
      immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the other Mexican, which he's the party who jumps our ponies in
      the first place, he throws up his hands an' allows he cashes in his chips
      for whatever the bank says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls ropes out our captive; sorter hog-ties him hand an' foot, wrist
      an' fetlock, an' then goes into camp all comfortable, where we runs up on
      our game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack Moore drops the loop of his lariat over the off moccasin of the
      deceased Mexican, an' canters his pony down the draw with him, so's we
      ain't offended none by the vision of him spraddled out that a-way dead.
      This yere's thoughtful of Jack, an' shows he's nacherally refined an'
      objects to remainders lyin' 'round loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, it ain't so much I'm refined,' says Jack, when I compliments him
      that he exhibits his bringin' up, an' him bein' too modest that a-way to
      accept; 'it ain't that I'm refined none&mdash;which my nacher is shore
      coarse&mdash;I jest sorter protests in my bosom ag'in havin' a corpse
      idlin' 'round that a-way where I'm camped. Tharfore I takes my rope an'
      snatches deceased off where he ain't noticeable on the scenery.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack does it that gentle an' considerate, too, that when we passes the
      Mexican next day on our way in, except he's some raveled an' frayed
      coastin' along where it's rocky, an' which can't be he'ped none, he's as
      excellent a corpse as when he comes off the shelf, warm as the rifle
      Enright throws him with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever be we goin' to do with this yere hoss-thief pris'ner of ours?'
      says Jack Moore to Enright the next day, when we're saddlin' up an'
      organizin' to pull our freight. 'He's shore due to bother us a lot. We're
      plumb sixty miles from Tutt an' the boys, an' ridin' herd on this yere
      saddle-colored gent, a-keepin' of him from lopin' off, is mighty likely to
      be a heap exhaustin'. I knows men,' Jack remarks at the close, lookin'
      wistful at Enright, 'as would beef him right yere an' leave him as a
      companion piece to that compadre of his you downs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nachers as would execute a pris'ner in cold blood,' says Enright, 'is
      roode an' oncivilized. Which I don't mean they is low neither; but it's
      onconsiderate that a-way to go an' ca'mly kill a pris'ner, an' no co't nor
      committee authorizin' the same. I never knows of it bein' done but once.
      It's Mexicans who does it then; which is why they ain't none pop'lar with
      me since.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's shore what you calls a mighty indurated play,' says Jack, shakin'
      his head, 'to go shootin' some he'pless gent you've took; but, as I
      states, it's a cinch it'll be a heap fatiguin' keepin' cases on this yere
      Mexican till we meets up with a quorum of the committee. Still it's our
      dooty, an' of course we don't double-deal, nor put back kyards on what's
      our plain dooty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What you-all states,' says Enright,'`is to your credit, but I'll tell
      you. Thar ain't no harm mountin' this marauder on a slow pony that a-way;
      an' bein' humane s'fficient to leave his hands an' feet ontied. Of course
      if he takes advantage of our leniency an' goes stampedin' off to make his
      escape some'ers along the trail, I reckons you'll shorely have to shoot.
      Thar's no pass-out then but down him, an' we sadly treads tharin. An','
      goes on Enright, some thoughtful, if this yere Mexican, after we-alls is
      that patient an' liberal with him, abuses our confidences an' escapes, we
      leaves it a lone-hand play to you. My eyes is gettin' some old an' off,
      any way; an' besides, if we three takes to bangin' away simooltaneous, in
      the ardor of competition some of us might shoot the pony. So if this yere
      captive runs&mdash;which he looks tame, an' I don't expect none he will&mdash;we
      leaves the detainin' of him, Jack, to you entire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In spite of Enright's faith it shore turns out this Mexican is ornery
      enough, where the trail skirts the river, to wheel sudden an' go plungin'
      across. But Jack gets him in midstream. As he goes over the bronco's
      shoulder, hat first, he swings on the bridle long enough with his dyin'
      hand to turn the pony so it comes out ag'in on our side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I'm glad he lives s'fficient to head that hoss our way,' says jack.
      "It saves splashin' across after him an' wettin' your leggins a lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's that night in camp when jack brings up what Enright says about the
      time the Mexicans downs a pris'ner, an' tharby fixes his views of 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a long trail back,' says Enright,' an' I don't like this yarn
      enough to find myse'f relatin' it to any excessive degrees. It draws the
      cinch some tight an' painful, an' I don't teach my mind to dwell on it no
      more'n is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This is all when I'm a boy; mebby I ain't twenty years yet. It's durin'
      the Mexican war. I gets a stack of white chips an' stands in on the deal
      in a boyish way. All I saveys of the war is it's ag'in the Mexicans,
      which, while I ain't got no feud with 'em personal at the time, makes it
      plenty satisfactory to me.
    </p>

      "'It's down off two days to the west of Chihuahua, an' seven of us is
      projectin' 'round seein' whatever can we tie down an' brand, when some
      Mexicans gets us out on a limb. It ain't a squar' deal; still I reckons
      it's squar' enough, too; only bein' what you-alls calls strategic, it's
      offensive an' sneakin' as a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere lieutenant who's leadin' us 'round permiscus, looks like he's
      some romantic about a young Mexican female, who's called the Princess of
      Casa Grande. Which the repoote of this yere Princess woman is bad, an' I
      strikes a story several times of how she's that incensed ag'in Americans
      she once saws off a thimbleful of loco on a captain in some whiskey he's
      allowin' to drink, an' he goes plumb crazy an' dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But loco or no loco, this yere Princess person is shore that good
      lookin' a pinto pony don't compare tharwith; an' when she gets her black
      eyes on our lieutenant,
    </p>
    <p>
      that settles it; we rounds up at her hacienda an' goes into camp.
      "'Besides
    </p>
    <p>
      the lieutenant thar's six of us. One of 'em's a shorthorn who matches me
      for age; which his name's Willis&mdash;Jim Willis. "'Now I ain't out
    </p>
    <p>
      to make no descriptions of the friendship which goes on between this yere
      Willis an' me. I sees a show one time when I'm pesterin' 'round back in
      St. Looey&mdash;an' I'm yere to remark I don't go that far east
    </p>
    <p>
      no more&mdash;which takes on about a couple of sports who's named Damon
      an' Pythias. Them two people's all right, an' game. An' they shore deems
      high of one another. But at the time I sees this yere Damon an'
    </p>
    <p>
      Pythias, I says to myse'f, an' ever since I makes onhesitatin' assertion
    </p>
    <p>
      tharof, that the brotherly views them two gents entertains ain't a
    </p>
    <p>
      marker to Jim Willis an' me. "'This yere Jim I knows since we're
      yearlin's. We-alls jumps outen the corral together back in Tennessee, an'
      goes off into this Mexican war like twins. An' bein' two boys that a-way
    </p>
    <p>
      among a band of men, I allows thar ain't nothin' before, nor then, nor
      after. which I loves like Jim. "'As I observes, Jim an' me's in
    </p>
    <p>
      the outfit when this yere lieutenant comes trackin' 'round that Princess
      of Casa Grande; which her love for him is a bluff an' a deadfall; an' the
      same gets all of us before we're through. An' it gets my Jim Willis
      speshul. "Mebby it's the third mornin' after we- alls meanders into this
      nest of Mexicans, an' the lieutenant gets lined out for that Princess of
      Casa Grande. We ain't been turnin' out early nohow, thar bein' nothin'
    </p>
    <p>
      to turn out about; but this third mornin' somebody arouses us a heap
      vigorous, like they aims to transact some business with us. Which they
      shorely does; it's an outfit of Greaser guerillas, an' we-alls ain't
      nothin' more or less than captives. "'The ornery an' ongrateful part is
      that the Princess sends one of her own peonies scoutin' 'round in the
      hills to bring in this band of cattle-eaters onto us. "'When the
      lieutenant hears of the perfidy of the Princess female, he's that
      mortified he gets a pistol the first jump he makes an' blows off the top
      of his head; which if he only blows off the top of hers it would have gone
      a heap further with the rest of us. If he'd consulted any of us, it would
      have shorely been advised. But he makes an impulsive play that
    </p>
    <p>
      a-way; an' is that sore an' chagrined he jest grabs a gun in a frenzied
      way an' cashes his chips abrupt. "'No, as I states,' says Enright, musin'
      to himse'f, 'if the lieutenant had only downed that Princess who plays us
      in as pris'ners so smooth an' easy, it would have been
    </p>
    <p>
      regarded. He could have gone caperin' over the brink after her with the
      bridle off the next second, an' we-alls would still talk well of him. "'As
      it is, however, this riotous female don't last two months. Which it's also
      a fact that takin' us that time must have been a heap
    </p>
    <p>
      on. lucky for them Greasers. Thar's nine of 'em, an' every last man dies
      in the next five months; an' never a one, nor yet the Princess, knows what
      they're ag'inst when they quits; or what breeze blows their light out. I
      knows, because me an' a party whose name is Tate- -Bill Tate&mdash;never
      leaves them hills till the last of that outfit's got his heap of rocks
      piled up, with its little pine cross stickin' outen the peak tharof,
      showin' he's done jumped this earthly game for good. "'This Bill Tate an'
      me breaks camp on them Greasers together while they're tankin' up on
      mescal, mebby it's two days later; an' they never gets their lariats on us
      no more. "'"You ain't got no dates, nor speshul engagements with nobody in
      the States, have you?" says Tate to me when
    </p>
    <p>
      we're safe outen them Mexican's hands. "'"No,"says I,"whatever makes you
      ask? "'"Oh, nothin',"says Tate lookin' at the sky sorter black an' ugly,
      "only since you-all has the leesure, what for a play would it be to make a
      long camp back in these hills by some water-hole some'ers,
    </p>
    <p>
      an' stand pat ontil we downs these yere Greasers&mdash;squaws an' all&mdash;
      who's had us treed? It oughter be did; an' if we-ails don't do it none,
      it's a heap likely it's goin' to be neglected complete. It's easy as a
      play; every hoss-thief of 'em lives right in these yere valleys, for I
      hears 'em talk. All we has to do is sa'nter back in the hills, make a
      camp; an' by bein' slow an' shore, an' takin' time an' pains, we
      bushwhacks an' kills the last one." "'The way I feels about Willis makes
      the prospect
    </p>
    <p>
      mighty allurin,' an' tharupon Tate an' me opens a game with them Mexicans
      it takes five months to deal. "'But it's plumb dealt out, an' we win. When
      Tate crosses the Rio Grande with the army goin' back, he shorely has the
      skelp of every Mexican incloosive of said Princess. "'But I wanders from
      Willis. Where was I at when I bogs down? As I says, this
    </p>
    <p>
      lieutenant nabs a pistol an' goes flutterin' from his limb. But this don't
      do them Greasers. They puts up a claim that some Americans tracks up on
      one of their outfit an' kills him off, they says, five days before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They allows that, breakin' even on the deal, one of us is due to die. Tate
      offers to let 'em count the lieutenant, but they shakes their heads till
      the little bells on their sombreros tinkles, an' declines the lieutenant
      emphatic. "'They p'ints out this yere lieutenant dies in his own game, on
      his own deal. It's no racket of theirs, an' it don't go to match the man
      they're shy. "`One of us six who's left has to die to count even for this
      Greaser who's been called in them five days ago. Tate can't move 'em; all
      he says is no use; so he quits,
    </p>
    <p>
      an' as he's been talkin' Spanish&mdash;which the same is too muddy a
      language for the rest of us&mdash;Tate turns in an' tells us how the thing
      sizes up. "`"One of us is shorely elected to trail out after the
      lieutenant,"says Tate. "The rest they holds as pris'ners. Either way it's
      a hard, deep crossin', an' one's about as rough a toss as the other."
      "'This last
    </p>
    <p>
      Tate stacks in to mebby win out a little comfort for the one the Mexicans
      cuts outen our bunch to kill. "`After a brief pow-wow the Greaser who's
      actin' range-boss for the outfit puts six beans in a buckskin bag. Five is
      white an' one's black. Them Greasers is on the gamble bigger'n wolves, an'
      they crowds up plenty gleeful to see us take a gambler's chance for our
      lives. The one of us who draws a black bean is to p'int out after the
      lieutenant. "`Sayin' somethin' in Spanish which most
    </p>
    <p>
      likely means" Age before beauty,"the Mexicans makes Willis an' me stand
      back while the four others searches one after the other into the bag for
      his bean. "`Tate goes first an' wins a white bean. "`Then a shiftless,
      no-account party whom we-alls calls "Chicken Bill" reaches in. I shorely
      hopes, seein' it's bound to be somebody, that this Chicken Bill acquires
      the black bean. But luck's ag'in us; Chicken Bill backs off with a white
      bean. "`When the third gent turns out a white bean the shadow begins to
      fall across Jim Willis an' me. I looks at Jim; an' I gives it to you
      straight when I says that I ain't at that time thinkin' of myse'f so much
      as about Jim. To see this yere deal, black as midnight, closin' in on Jim,
      is what's hurtin'; it don't somehow occur to me I'm likewise up ag'in the
      iron my se'f. "`"Looks like this yere amiable deevice is out to run its
      brand onto one of us,"says Jim to me; an' I looks at him. "`An' then, as
      the fourth finds a white bean in the bag, an' draws a deep sigh an' stands
      back, Jim says: "Well, Sam, it's up to us." Then Jim looks at me keen an'
      steady a whole lot, an' the Mexicans, bein' rather pleased with the
      situation, ain't goadin' of us to hurry up none.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`When it's to Jim an' me they selects me out as the one to pull for the
      next bean. Jim's still lookin' at me hard, an' I sees the water in his
      eye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`"Let me have your draw, Sam," he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`"Shore,"I replies, standin' a step off from the bag." It's yours too
      quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "` But the Mexicans don't see it that a-way. It's my turn an' my draw, an'
      Jim has to take what's left. So the Mexicans tells Tate to send me after
      my bean ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`"Hold on a second, Sam," says Jim, an' by this time he's steady as a
      church. "Sam," he goes on, "thar's no use you&mdash;all gettin' the short
      end of this. Thar's reasons for you livin', which my case is void tharof.
      Now let me ask you: be you up on beans? Can you tell a black from a white
      bean by the feel? "
    </p>
    <p>
      "`"No," I says, "beans is all a heap the same to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"That's what I allows," goes on this Jim. "Now yere's where my sooperior
      knowledge gets in. If these Mexicans had let me draw for you I'd fixed it,
      but it looks like they has scrooples. But listen, an' you beats the deal
      as it is. Thar's a difference in beans same as in ponies. Black beans is
      rough like a cactus compared to white beans, which said last vegetable is
      shorely as smooth as glass. Now yere's what you&mdash;all does; jest grp[e
      an' scout 'round in that bag until you picks out the smooth bean. That's
      your bean; that's the white bean. Cinch the smooth bean an' the black one
      comes to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Jim says all this it seems like I'm in a daze an' sorter woozy. I
      never doubts him for a moment. Of course I don't take no advantage of what
      he says. I recalls the advice my old mother gives me; it's long enough ago
      now. The old lady says: "Samyool, never let me hear of you weakenin'. Be a
      man, or a mouse, or a long-tail rat." So when Jim lays it off about them
      two beans bein' smooth an' rough that a-way, an' the white bein' the
      smooth bean, I nacherally searches out the rough bean, allowin' she'll
      shore be black; which shows my intellects can't cope with Jim's none.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`The bean I brings to the surface is white. I'm pale as a ghost. My heart
      wilts like water inside of me, an' I feels white as the bean where it lays
      in my hand. Of course I'm some young them days, an' it don't need so much
      to stagger me. "`I recollects like it was in a vision hearin' Jim laugh.
      "Sam," he says, "I reads you like so much sunshine. An' I shorely fools
      you up a lot. Don't you reckon I allows you'll double on the trail,
      p'intin' south if I says 'north' at a show like this? The white bean is
      allers a rough, sandy bean; allers was an' allers will be; an' never let
      no one fool you that a- way ag'in. An' now, Sam, ADIOS."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm standin' lookin' at the white bean. I feels Jim grip my other hand
      as lie says "ADIOS," an' the next is the" bang! "of the Mexicans's guns.
      Jim's dead then; he's out in a second; never bats an eye nor wags a y'ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which now,' says Enright at the end, as he yanks his saddle 'round so he
      makes a place for his head, 'which now that you-alls is fully informed why
      I appears averse to Greasers, I reckons I'll slumber some. I never does
      see one, I don't think of that boy, Jim Willis; an' I never thinks of Jim
      but I wants to murder a Mexican.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright don't say no more; sorter rolls up in his blankets, drops his
      head on his saddle, an' lays a long time quiet, like he's asleep. Jack
      Moore an' me ain't sayin' nothin'; merely settin' thar peerin' into the
      fire an' listenin' to the coyotes. At last Enright lifts his head off the
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mebby it's twenty years ago when a party over on the Rio Grande allows
      as how Jim's aimin' to cold-deck me when he onfolds about the habits of
      them beans. It takes seven months, a iron constitootion, an' three
      medicine-sharps&mdash;an' each as good as Doc Peets,&mdash;before that Rio
      Grande party is regarded as outen danger.'"

      CHAPTER VI. TUCSON JENNIES HEART.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "'Whyever ain't I married?' says you." The Old Cattleman repeated the
      question after me as he settled himself for one of our many "pow-wows," as
      he described them. "Looks like you've dealt me that conundrum before. Why
      ain't I wedded? The answer to that, son, is a long shot an' a limb in the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I reckons the reason why I'm allers wifeless a whole lot is mainly
      due to the wide pop'larity of them females I takes after. Some other gent
      sorter gets her first each time, an' nacherally that bars me. Bill Jenks's
      wife on that occasion is a spec'men case. That's one of the
      disapp'intments I onfolds to you. Now thar's a maiden I not only wants,
      but needs; jest the same, Bill gets her. An' it's allers sim'lar; I never
      yet holds better than ace-high when the stake's a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's troo," he continued, reflectively puffing his pipe. "I was
      disp'sitioned for a wife that a-way when I'm a colt. But that's a long
      time ago; I ain't in line for no sech gymnastics no more; my years is 'way
      ag'in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got to ketch folks young to marry 'em. After they gets to be
      thirty years they goes slowly to the altar. If you aims to marry a gent
      after he's thirty you has to blindfold him an' back him in. Females, of
      course, ain't so obdurate. No; I s'pose this yere bein' married is a heap
      habit, same as tobacco an' jig-juice. If a gent takes a hand early, it's a
      good game, I makes no sort of doubt. But let him get to millin' 'round in
      the thirties or later, an' him not begun none as yet; you bet he don't
      marry nothin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bar an onexplainable difference with the girl's old man," he went on with
      an air of thought, "I s'pose I'd be all married right now. I was twenty,
      them times. It's 'way back in Tennessee. Her folks lives about 'leven
      miles from me out on the Pine Knot Pike, an' once in two weeks I saddles
      up an' sorter sidles over. Thar's jest her old pap an' her mother an' her
      in the fam'ly, an' it's that far I allers made to stay all night. Thar's
      only two beds, an' so I'm put to camp along of the old man the times I
      stays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them days I'm 'way bashful an' behind on all social plays, an' am plenty
      awe-struck about the old foiks. I never feels happy a minute where they
      be. The old lady does her best to make me easy an' free, too. Comes out
      when I rides up, an' lets down the bars for my hoss, an' asks me to rest
      my hat the second I'm in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which matters goes on good enough ontil mebby it's the eighth time I'm
      thar. I remembers the night all perfect. Me an' the girl sets up awhile,
      an' then I quits her an' turns in. I gets to sleep a-layin' along the aige
      of the bed, aimin' to keep 'way from the old man, who's snorln' an'
      thrashin' 'round an' takin' on over in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't recall much of nothin' ontil I comes to, a-holdin' to the old
      man's y'ear with one hand an' a-hammerin' of his features with t'other. I
      don't know yet, why. I s'pose I'm locoed an' dreamin', an allows he's a
      b'ar or somethin' in my sleep that a-way, an' tries to kill him. "Son,
      it's 'way back a long time, but I shudders yet when I reflects on that old
      man's language. I jumps up when I realizes things, grabs my raiment, an',
      gettin' my hoss outen the corral, goes p'intin' down the pike more'n a
      mile 'fore I even stops to dress. The last I sees of the old man lie's
      buckin' an' pitchin' an' tossin', an' the females a-holdin' of him, an' he
      reachin' to get a Hawkins's rifle as hangs over the door. I never goes
      back no more, 'cause he's mighty tindictive about it. He tries to make it
      a grandjury matter next co't-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speakin' of nuptials, however, you can't tell much about women. Thar's a
      girl who shorely s'prises us once in a way out in Wolfville. Missis
      Rucker, who runs the O. K. Restauraw, gets this female from Tucson to fry
      flap-jacks an' salt hoss, an' he'p her deal her little gastronomic game.
      This yere girl's name is Jennie- Tucson Jennie. She looks like she's a
      nice, good girl, too; one of them which it's easy to love, an' in less'n
      two weeks thar's half the camp gets smitten. "It affects business, it's
      that bad. Cherokee Hall tells me thar ain't half the money gets changed in
      at faro as usual, an' the New York Store reports gents goin' broke ag'in
      biled shirts, an' sim'lar deadfalls daily. Of course this yere first
      frenzy subsides a whole lot after a month. "All this time Jennie ain't
      sayin' a word. She jest shoves them foolish yooths their enchiladas an'
      ckile con carne, an' ignores all winks an' looks complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's a party named Jim Baxter in camp, an' he sets in to win Jennie
      hard. Jim tries to crowd the game an' get action. It looks like he's due
      to make the trip too. Missis Rucker is backin' his play, an' Jennie
      herse'f sorter lets him set 'round in the kitchen an' watch her work;
      which this yore is license an' riot itse'f compared with how she treats
      others. Occasionally some of us sorter tries to stack up for Jim an'
      figger out where he stands with the the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How's it goin', Baxter?' Enright asks one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's too many for me,' says Jim. 'Some-times I thinks I corrals her, an'
      then ag'in it looks like I ain't in it. Jest now I'm feelin' some
      dejected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Somethin' oughter be schemed to settle this yere,' says Enright. 'It
      keeps the camp in a fever, an' mebby gets serious an' spreads.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If somebody would only prance in,' says Doc Peets, 'an' shoot Jim up
      some, you'd have her easy. Females is like a rabbit in a bush- pile; you
      has to shake things up a lot to make 'em come out. Now, if Jim is dyin'
      an' she cares for him, she's shorely goin' to show her hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wants to pause right yere to observe that Doc Peets is the best-
      eddicated sharp I ever encounters in my life. An' what he don't know about
      squaws is valueless as information. But to go on with the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's right,' says Cherokee Hall, 'but of course it ain't goin' to do
      to shoot Jim up none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't know,' says Jim; 'I stands quite a racket if I'm shore it
      fetches her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for a game,' says Cherokee, 'would it be to play like Jim's shot?
      Wouldn't that make her come a-runnin' same as if it's shore 'nough?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't see why not,' says Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the idee gains ground like an antelope, an' at last gets to be
      quite a conspir'cy. It's settled we plays it, with Dave Tutt to do the
      shootin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' we makes the game complete,' says Jack Moore, 'by grabbin' Dave
      immediate an' bringin' of him before the committee, which convenes all
      reg'lar an' deecorous in the Red Light for said purpose. We-alls must line
      out like we're goin' to hang Dave for the killin'; otherwise it don't look
      nacheral nohow, an' the lady detects it's a bluff.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We gets things all ready, an' in the middle of the afternoon, when Jennie
      is draggin' her lariat 'round loose an' nothin' much to do&mdash; 'cause
      we ain't aimin' to disturb her none in her dooties touchin' them flapjacks
      an' salt hoss&mdash;we-alls assembles over in the New York Store. As a
      preliminary step we lays Jim on some boxes, with a wagon-cover over him,
      like he's deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cl'ar things out of the way along by Jim's head,' says Jack Moore, who
      is takin' a big interest. 'We wants to fix things so Jen can swarm in at
      him easy. You hear me! she's goin' to come stampedin' in yere like wild
      cattle when she gets the news.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When everythin's ready, Tutt an' Jack, who concloods it's well to have a
      good deal of shootin', bangs away with their guns about four times apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Jest shootin' once or twice,' says Jack, 'might arouse her s'picions. It
      would be a heap too brief for the real thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The minute the shootin' is ceased we-alls takes Tutt an' surges over to
      the Red Light to try him; a-pendin' of which Dan Boggs sa'nters across to
      the O. K. Restauraw an' remarks, all casooal an' careless like:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Dave Tutt downs Jim Baxter a minute back; good clean gun-play as ever I
      sees, too. Mighty big credit to both boys this yere is. No shootin' up the
      scenery an' the bystanders; no sech slobberin' work; but everythin'
      carries straight to centers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where is he?' says Jennie, lookin' breathless an' sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Jim's remainder is in the New York Store,' says Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Is he hurt?' she gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't reckon he hurts none now,' says Dan, ''cause he's done cashed in
      his stack. Why! girl, he's dead; eighteen bullets, caliber forty-five,
      plumb through him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, but Dave! Is Dave shot?' Tucson Jennie says, a-wringin' of her small
      paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now don't you go to feelin' discouraged none,' says Dan, beginnin' to
      feel sorry for her. 'We fixes the wretch so his murderin' sperit won't be
      an hour behind Jim's gettin' in. The Stranglers has him in the Red Light,
      makin' plans to stretch him right now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls has consoomed drinks all 'round, an' Enright is in the chair, an'
      we're busy settin' up a big front about hearin' the case, when Tucson
      Jennie, with a scream as scares up surroundin' things to sech a limit that
      five ponies hops out of the corral an' flies, comes chargin' into the Red
      Light, an' the next instant she drifts 'round Tutt's neck like so much
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for a game do you call this, anyhow?' says Jack Moore, who's a heap
      scand'lized. 'Is this yere maiden playin' anythin' on this camp?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'She's plumb locoed with grief,' says Dan Boggs, who follers her in, 'an'
      she's done got 'em mixed in her mind. She thinks Dave is Baxter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's it,' says Cherokee. 'Her mind's stampeded with the shock. Me an'
      Jack takes her over to Jim's corpse, an' that's shore to revive her.' An'
      with that Cherokee an' Jack goes up to lead her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Save him, Mister Enright; save him!' she pleads, still clingin' to
      Tutt's neck like the loop of a lariat. 'Don't let 'em hang him! Save him
      for my sake!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hold on, Jack,' says Enright, who by now is lookin' some thoughtful.
      'Jest everybody stand their hands yere till I counts the pot an' notes
      who's shy. It looks like we're cinchin' the hull onto the wrong bronco.
      Let me ask this female a question. Young woman,' he says to Tucson Jennie,
      'be you fully informed as to whose neck you're hangin' to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's Dave's, ain't it?' she says, lookin' all tearful in his face to
      make shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright an' the rest of us don't say nothin', but gazes at each other.
      Tutt flushes up an' shows pleased both at once. But all the same he puts
      his arms 'round her like the dead-game gent he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What'll you-alls have, gents?" Enright says at last, quiet an'
      thoughtful. 'The drinks is on me, barkeep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Excuse me,' says Doc Peets, 'but as the author of this yere plot, I
      takes it the p'ison is on me. Barkeep, set out all your bottles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gents,' says Jack Moore, 'I'm as peaceful a person as ever jingled a
      spur or pulled a gun in Wolfville; but as I reflects on the active part I
      takes in these yere ceremonies, I won't be responsible for results if any
      citizen comes between me an' payin' for the drinks. Barkeep, I'm doin'
      this myse'f.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's hard enoomeratin' how many drinks we do have. Jim Baxter
      throws away the wagon cover an' comes over from the New York Store an'
      stands in with us. It gets to be a orgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Of course it's all right,' says Enright, 'the camp wins with Tutt
      instead of Baxter; that's all. It 'lustrates one of them beautiful
      characteristics of the gentler sex, too. Yere's Baxter, to say nothin' of
      twenty others, as besieges an' beleaguers this yere female for six weeks,
      an' she scorns 'em. Yere's Tutt, who ain't makin' a move, an' she grabs
      him. It is sech oncertainties, gents, as makes
    </p>
    <p>
      the love of woman valuable.' "'You-alls should have asked me,' says Faro
      Nell, who comes in right then an' rounds up close to Cherokee. 'I could
      tell you two weeks ago Jennie's in love with Tutt. Anybody could see it.
      Why! she's been feedin' of him twice as good grub as she does anybody
      else.'"

      CHAPTER VII. TUCSON JENNIE'S JEALOUSY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "No; Dave an' his wife prospers along all right. That is, they prospers
      all but once; that's when Jennie gets jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman was responding to my question. I was full of an idle
      interest and disposed to go further into the affairs of Tutt and Tucson
      Jennie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets," continued the old gentleman, "allers tells me on the side
      thar's nothin' in Dave's conduct onbecomin' a fam'ly man that a-way, an'
      that Jen's simply barkin' at a knot. But, however that is, Dave don't seem
      to gain no comfort of it at the time. I can see myse'f she gets Dave plumb
      treed an' out on a limb by them accusations when she makes 'em. He shorely
      looks guilty; an' yet, while I stands over the play from the first, I
      can't see where Dave does wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, I don't put myse'f for'ard as no good jedge in domestic affairs.
      Bein' single myse'f that a-way, females is ondoubted what Doc Peets calls
      a 'theery' with me. But nevertheless, in an onpresoomin', lowly way, I
      gives it as my meager jedgement, an' I gives it cold, as how a jealous
      woman is worse than t'rant'lers. She's plumb locoed for one thing; an'
      thar's no sech thing as organizin' to meet her game. For myse'f, I don't
      want no transactions with 'em; none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere domestic uprisin' of Dave's wife breaks on Wolfville as
      onexpected as a fifth ace in a poker deck; it leaves the camp all
      spraddled out. Tucson Jennie an' Dave's been wedded goin' on six months.
      The camp, as I relates, attends the nuptials in a body, an', followin' of
      the festivities, Tucson Jennie an' Dave tumbles into housekeepin' peaceful
      as two pups in a basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wolfville's proud of 'em, an'every time some ign'rant bein' asks about
      Wolfville an' the social features of the camp, we allers mentions Tutt an'
      his wife, an' tells how they keeps house, sorter upholsterin' our bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's how the deal stands, when one day up jumps this Tucson Jennie,
      puts on her sunbunnit, an' goes stampedin' down to the U. K. House, an'
      allows to Missis Rucker that she's done lived with Dave all she aims to,
      an' has shore pulled her picket pin for good. She puts it up Dave is a
      base, deceitful sharp that a-way, an' informs Missis Rucker, all mixed up
      with tears, as how she now desires to go back in the kitchen an' cook,
      same as when Dave rounds her up for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yere's the whole story, an' while I nurses certain views tharon, I leaves
      it to you entire to say how much Tucson Jennie is jestified. I knows all
      about it, for I'm obleeged to be in on the deal from soda to hock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mighty likely a month before the time Tucson Jennie breaks through
      Dave's lines this a-way. Dave an' me's due to go over towards the Tres
      Hermanas about some cattle. Likewise thar's an English outfit allowin'
      they'll go along some, to see where they've been stackin' in heavy on some
      ranch lands. They was eager for Dave an' me to trail along with 'em, an'
      sorter ride herd on' em, an' keep 'em from gettin' mixed up with the
      scenery&mdash;which the same is shorely complicated in the foot-hills of
      the Tres Hermanas&mdash;an' losin' themse'fs a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which you'd better do it, boys,' says Enright. 'S'pose them folks be
      some trouble. It's a mighty sight better than havin' 'em go p'intin' off
      alone that a-way. They would shore miss the way if they does; an' the
      first we-alls knows, these yere Britons would be runnin' cimmaron in the
      hills, scarin' up things a lot, an' a- stampedin' the cattle plumb off the
      range. It's easier to go along careful with 'em an' bring'em back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It comes, then, that one mornin' Dave an' me an' these yere aliens lines
      out for the hills. They've got ponies, an' wagons, an' camp- outfit to
      that extent a casooal onlooker might think they aims to be away for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As we p'ints out from the O.K. House, where them Britons has been
      wrastlin' their chuck pendin' the start, Tucson Jennie is thar sayin'
      'goodby' to Dave. I notes then she ain't tickled to death none about
      somethin', but don't deem nothin' speshul of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Britons is made up of two gents, mebby as old as Enright&mdash;
      brothers is what they be&mdash;an' a female who's the daughter of one of
      'em. Which thar's nothin' recent about this yere lady, though; an' I
      reckons she's mighty likely forty years old. I learns later, however, it's
      this female which Tucson Jennie resents when she says "adios" to Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shore strikes me now, when years is passed, as some marv'lous how a
      han'some, corn-fed female like Tucson Jennie manages to found a fight with
      Dave over this yere towerist woman. I'm nacherally slow to go decidin'
      bets ag'in a lady's looks, but whatever Tucson Jennie sees in the
      appearance of this person which is likely to inviggle Dave is too many for
      me. I softens the statement a heap when I says she's uglier than a Mexican
      sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, that don't seem to occur to Tucson Jennie; an' Doc Peets&mdash;
      who's the wisest sharp in Arizona&mdash;allows to me afterwards as how
      Tucson Jennie is cuttin' the kyards with herse'f desp'rate to see whether
      she declar's war at the very time we makes our start. If she does, she
      turns the low kyard, for she don't say nothin', an' we gets away, an' all
      is profound peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four days later we're in camp by a water-hole in the frill of the
      foot-hills. The Britons has got up a wall tent an' is shorely havin' a
      high an' lavish time. Dave an' me ain't payin' no attention to 'em
      speshul, as we don't see how none is needed. Besides, we has some hard
      ridin' to do lookin' up places for a line of sign camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the second day when we notices an outfit of Injuns camped down the
      valley from us. They's all serene an' peaceful enough; with squaws,
      papooses, an' dogs; an' ain't thinkin' no more of bein' hostile than we
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, no sooner does these yere Britons of ours behold this band of
      savages than they has to go projectin' round 'em. That's the worst thing
      about a towerist; he's that loaded with cur'osity, an' that gregar'ous an'
      amiable, he has to go foolin' 'round every stranger lie tracks up with. In
      their ign'rance they even gets that roode an' insultin' at times, that I
      knows 'em who's that regardless an' imp'lite as to up an' ask a rank
      stranger that a-way to pass'em his gun to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' so, as I says, no sooner does them Injuns get near us, than them
      three blessed foreigners is over after 'em; ropin' at em' with questions
      an' invadin' of 'em, an' examinin' of 'em like the whole tribe's for sale
      an' they aims to acquire 'em if figgers is reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never does know what the female towerist says or does to that
      partic'lar aborigine-nothin' most likely; but it ain't a day when one of
      them Injuns settles it with himse'f he wants to wed her. The towerists is
      in ign'rance of the views of this savage, who goes about dealin' his game
      Injun fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this a-way: Dave an' me trails in one evenin' some weary an' played;
      it's been a hard ride that day. Which the first thing we lays eyes on at
      the camp shorely livens us up a lot. Thar, tied to the wagon-wheels, is
      nine ponies, which the same belongs to the Injuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever be these y ere broncos doin' yere?' says Dave, for we allows,
      the first dash outen the box, mebby the Britons makes a purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the towerists tells a long an' delighted story about the
      gen'rosity of the Injuns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Actooally,' says this towerist,"them gen'rous savages leads up these
      yere nine ponies an' donates 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave an' me asks questions; and all thar is to the deal&mdash;which it's
      shore enough to bust Dave's fam'ly before it's over&mdash;them Injuns
      brings up the nine ponies all respectful, an' leaves 'em hobbled out,
      mebby it's a hundred yards from the Britons, an' rides away. The Britons,
      deemin' this bluff as in the line of gifts, capers over an' possesses
      themse'fs of the ponies an' leads 'em in. That's the outside of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, stranger,' says Dave in reply, takin' of the towerist one side, 'I
      ain't aimin' to discourage you none, but you-alls has gone an' got all
      tangled up in your lariat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for an ontanglement is it?' asks the towerist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nothin',' says Dave, sorter breakin' it to him easy, 'nothin', only
      you've done married your daughter to one of them Injuns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Dave announces this yere trooth it shore looks like the Briton's
      goin' to need whiskey to uphold himse'f. But he reorganizes, an' Dave
      explains that the Injuns, when they trails in with the ponies, is simply
      shufflin' for a weddin'; they's offerin' what they-alls calls a 'price'
      for the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' when you-alls leads in the ponies,' says Dave,'that settles it. You
      agrees to deal right thar. To-morrow, now, this yere buck, whoever he is,
      will come surgin' in with his relations plumb down to third cousins; an'
      he expects you'll be dead ready to feed 'em, an' wind up the orgy by
      passin' over the bride.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can bet them reecitals of Dave's is plenty horrible to the towerist.
      He allows we must keep it from his daughter; an' then he puts hip whole
      outfit in Dave's hands, to get 'em safe onto high grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Can't we pull our freight in the night?'says the towerist, an' he's
      shorely anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Too much moon,' says Dave; 'an' then, ag'in, the whole Injun outfit's
      below us in the draw, an' we never gets by once in a thousand times. No,'
      goes on Dave, 'one shore thing we can't back out nor crawl off. We-alls
      has to play the hand plumb through:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Dave tells the towerist him an' me talks over this yere weddin'
      which he done goes into so inadvertent; an' if thar's a chance to save him
      from becomin' a father-in-law abrupt, we'll play it to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere is the only wagon-track out; says Dave to me, after we
      pow-wows an hour. 'You go down to them Injuns, an' find the right buck
      that a-way, an' tell him the squaw's got a buck now. Tell him he's barred.
      Which at this p'int in your revelations he's due to offer a fight, an' of
      course you takes him. Tell him at first-drink time to-morrow mornin' he
      finds me ready to fight for the squaw.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This whole business makes metired, though,' says Dave, a heap disgustad.
      ' If these eediots had let them Injuns alone-, or even if they disdains
      the ponies when they was brought up, this yere could be fixed easy. But
      now it's fight or give up the woman, so you go down, as I says, an'
      arrange for the dance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course thar's no explainin' nothin' to Injuns. You might as well waste
      time expoundin' to coyotes an' jack-rabbits. All that's left for me to do
      is trail out after my savage, as Dave says, an' notify him that this
      weddin' he pro. poses is postponed an' all bets is off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I finds him easy enough, an' saws it off on him in Spanish how the game
      stacks up. But he ain't cheerful about it, an' displays a mighty baleful
      sperit. Jest as Tutt allows he's out to shoot for the squaw in a minute,
      an' as thar's no gettin' away from it, I tells him to paint himse'f for
      war an' come a-runnin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I has to carry a hard face; for we're shorely in for it. Yere we be four
      days from Wolfville, an' the Injuns&mdash;an' I reckons thar's twenty
      bucks in the outfit-is camped in between us an' he'p.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Injun who's after the woman is named Black Dog. The next mornin'
      Tutt saddles up an' rides off to one side of our camp, mebby it's a
      quarter of a mile, an' then gets offen his pony an' stands thar. We-alls
      don't onfold to the towerists the details of the deal, not even to the
      Injun's father-in-law. The towerist female is that ign'rant of what's
      going' on, she's pesterin' 'round all onconscious, makin' bakin'-powder
      biscuit at the time. I looks at her close, an' I wonders even yet what
      that Black Dog's thinkin' of. But I don't get much time to be disgusted
      over this Black Dog's taste before he comes p'intin' out from among his
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun's jest gettin' over the hills to the east, an', as it strikes
      him, he's shore a fash'nable lookin' Injun. He ain't got nothin' on but a
      war-bunnit an' a coat of paint. The rest of his trousseau he confines to
      his Winchester an' belt. He's on his war- pony, an' the bronco's stripped
      as bare as this Black Dog is; not a strap from muzzle to tail. This
      bridegroom Injun's tied its mane full of ribbons, an' throws a red blanket
      across his pony's withers for general effects. Take it all over, he's a
      nifty-lookin' savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far as the dooel goes, Dave ain't runnin' no resk. He stands thar on
      the ground an' keeps his hoss between him an' this yere Black Dog. It's a
      play which forces the bridegroom's hand, too. He's due, bein' Injun, to go
      cirelin' Dave an' do his shootin' on the canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that's what this weak-minded savage does. He breaks into a lope an'
      goes sailin' 'round Dave like a hawk. Durin' them exercises he lays over
      on the shoulder of his hoss an' bangs away from onder its neck with one
      hand, permiscus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is mere frivolity. Thar ain't no white gent who could shoot none
      onder sech conditions; an' Injuns can't shoot nohow. They don't savey a
      hind sight. An', as I remarks, if Dave's hit any, it's goin' to shorely be
      an accident, an' accidents don't happen none in Arizona; leastwise not
      with guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mebby this Black Dog's banged away three times, when Dave, who's been
      followin' of him, through the sights for thirty seconds, onhooks his
      rifle, an' the deal comes to a full stop. Dave's shootin' a Sharp's, with
      a hundred an' twenty grains of powder, an' the way he sends a bullet plumb
      through that war-pony an' this yere Black Dog, who's hangin' on its off
      side, don't bother him a bit. The pony an' the Black Dog goes over on
      their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave rides in, an' brings the blanket an' war-bunnit. Even then, the
      female towerist, which is the object of the meetin', don't seem informed
      none of the course of events. The fact is, she never does acquire the
      rights of it till we-alls is two days back on the return trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's no more bother. Injuns is partic'lar people, that a-way, about
      etiquette as they saveys it, an' followin' Dave's downin' this Black Dog
      they ain't makin' a moan or a move. They takes it plenty solemn an' mute,
      an' goes to layin' out the Black Dog's obsequies without no more notice of
      us. It's a squar deal; they sees that; an' they ain't filin' no
      objections. As for our end of the game, we moves out for Wolfville, makin'
      no idle delays whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goin' in, Dave, after thinkin' some, su'gests to me that it's likely to
      be a heap good story not to tell Tucson Jennie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Females is illogical, that a-way,' says Dave, 'an' I ain't goin' to have
      time to eddicate Jennie to a proper view of this yere. So I reckons it's
      goin' to be a crafty play not to tell her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Britons has been gone two weeks when Tucson Jennie learns the story.
      Them towerists is plumb weary of Arizona when we trails into Wolfville,
      an' don't seem to tarry a second before they lines out for Tucson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They jest hits a high place or two,' says Jack Moore, after he hears of
      them designs of the Black Dog, 'an' they'll be 'way yonder out of the
      country. I don't reckon none of 'em'll ever come back soon, neither.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's the towerist woman makes the trouble from start to finish. It's
      a letter from her which she writes back to Dave, allowin' she'll thank him
      some more as her preserver, that brings the news to Jennie. Tucson Jennie
      gets this missive, an' ups an' rifles an' reads it to herse'f a whole lot.
      It's then Tucson Jennie gives it out cold, Dave is breakin' her heart, an'
      tharupon prances 'round for her shaker an' goes over to Missis Rucker's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole camp knows the story in an hour, an' while we-ails sympathizes
      with Dave of course, no one's blamin' Tucson Jennie. She's a female, an'
      onresponsible, for one thing; an' then, ag'in Dave's a heap onlikely to
      stand any condemnations of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'She's as good a woman as ever wears a moccasin,' says Dave, while he's
      recoverin' of his sperits at the Red Light bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' we-alls allows she shorely is; an' then everybody looks pensive an'
      sincere that a-way, so's not to harrow Dave none an' make his burdens
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But whatever can I do to fetch her back to camp?' asks Dave, appealin'
      to Enright mighty wretched. 'I goes plumb locoed if this yere keeps on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My notion is, we-alls better put Missis Rucker in to play the hand,'
      says Enright. 'Missis Rucker's a female, an' is shorely due to know what
      kyards to draw. But this oughter be a lesson to you, Dave, not to go
      romancin' 'round with strange women no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a forced play, I tells you,' says Dave. 'Them Injuns has us treed.
      It's a case of fight or give up that she-towerist, so what was I to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Well,' says Enright, some severe,' you might at least have consulted
      with this yere towerist woman some. But you don't. You simply gets a gun
      an' goes trackin' 'round in her destinies, an' shootin' up her prospects
      like you has a personal interest. You don't know but she deplores the deal
      complete. Peets, an' me, an' Boggs, an' all the rest of us is your
      friends, an' nacherally partial on your side. We-alls figgers you means
      well. But what I says is this: It ain't no s'prisin' thing when Tucson
      Jennie, a- hearin' of them pronounced attentions which you pays this
      towerist lady, is filled with grief. This shootin' up an Injun, cause he's
      plannin' to wed this female some, is what I shorely calls pronounced
      attentions. What do you think yourse'f, Peets?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why! I readily concedes what Dave says,' remarks Peets. 'Ondoubtedly he
      acts for the best as he sees it. But jest as you puts it: s'pose Dave
      ain't hungerin' none for this towerist woman himse'f, the headlong way he
      goes after this yere Black Dog, settin' of the war-jig the next sun-up,
      an' all without even sayin' "Let me look at your hand," to this female,
      jestifies them inferences of yours. Of course I don't say&mdash;an' I
      don't reckon none&mdash;Dave thinks of this old-maid maverick once; but,
      he sees himse'f, ht shore goes to war a heap precipitate an'
      onconsiderate, an' Tucson Jennie has ondoubted grounds to buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which, when you-alls puts it so cl'ar, I thinks so too,' says Dave,
      who's listenin' to Enright an' Peets a mighty sight dejected. I But I
      ain't been wedded long&mdash;ain't more'n what you might call an amature
      husband. What you-alls oughter do now is he'p me to round her up. If
      Tucson Jennie's a bunch of cattle, or a band of ponies as has stampeded,
      you'd be in the saddle too quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missis Rucker shore does all she knows to soften Tucson Jennie. She
      reminds her how in the old times, when Dave gets his chile con carne at
      the O. K. House, and the party from the States takes to reprovin' of
      Missis Rucker about thar bein' nothin' but coffee an' beans to eat, Dave
      onlimbers his six-shooter an' goes to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The grub's dealt down,' says Dave, explainin' to this obnoxious
      tenderfoot, 'till thar's nothin' left in the box but beans, coffee, an'
      beans. It's a cat-hop, but it can't be he'ped none.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cat-hop or no cat-hop,' says this tenderfoot, 'I'm dead ag'in beans; an'
      you can gamble I ain't out to devour no sech low veg'tables; none
      whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You jest thinks you don't like beans,' says Dave, an' with that he
      sorter dictates at the tenderfoot with his gun, an' the tenderfoot
      thar-upon lays for his frijoles like he's actooally honin' tharfor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which it all shows Dave's got a good heart,' says Missis Rucker to
      Tucson Jennie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's nothin' to do with his makin' love to the British woman,' says
      Tucson Jennie, grittin' her teeth like she could eat the sights offen a
      six-shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He never makes no love to this yere woman,' says Missis Rucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When he ketches her flirtin' with that Injun,' demands Tucson Jennie,
      'don't Dave shoot him up a lot? What do you-all call makin' love? He never
      downs no Injuns for me, an' I'm his lawful wife.' An' yere Missis Rucker
      allows, when she reports to Enright an' Dave an' the rest of the outfit in
      the Red Light, Tucson Jennie weeps like her heart is shorely broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the pore girl's to be pitied,' says Enright. 'Dave,' he goes on,
      turnin' to Tutt some fierce, 'you don't deserve no sech devotion as this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever,' says Dan Boggs, lookin' red an' truculent, 'this yere
      Tucson Jennie's a angel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But thar we be, up ag'inst it, an' not a man knows a thing to do to
      squar' the deal with Dave's wife. We-alls, calls for drinks all 'round,
      an' sets about an' delib'rates. At last Dave speaks up in a low-sperited
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I reckons she done jumps the game for good,' he says. 'But if she's
      goin', I wants her to have a layout. If you-alls cares to go over to the
      New York Store, I allows I'll play in a blue stack or two an' win her out
      some duds. I wants her to quit the deal ahead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Dave sets out for the New York Store, an' the rest of us sorter
      straggles along. Thar's nothin' gay about us. Dave gets a shawl an' a
      dress; nothin' gaudy; it's a plain red an' yaller. Missis Rucker packs 'em
      over to Tucson Jennie an' gets that wrapped up in the deal she forgets
      utter to rustle us our grub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, it's the onexpeeted as happens in Wolfville same as everywhere
      else. The minute Tucson Jennie sees the raiment, an' realizes how Dave
      loves her, that settles it. Her heart melts right thar. She ain't sayin'
      nothin'; jest ropes onto the dry-goods an' starts sobbin' out for the
      'doby where she an' Dave lives at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dave, when he observes this yere from 'cross the street, shakes hands all
      'round, but don't trust himse'f with no remarks. He gives our paws a
      squeeze like he knows he can rely on our friendship an' hunts his way
      across to Tucson Jennie without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's all right about bein' yoothful an' light, that a-way,' says
      Enright, after Dave pulls his freight, 'but Tutt oughter remember
      yereafter, before he goes mixin' himse'f up with sech vain things as
      towerists an' Injuns an' British, that he's a married man.'"

      CHAPTER VIII. THE MAN FROM RED DOG.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Let me try one of them thar seegyars."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the pleasant after-dinner hour, and I was on the veranda for a
      quiet smoke. The Old Cattleman had just thrown down his paper; the
      half-light of the waning sun was a bit too dim for his eyes of seventy
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever I beholds a seegyar," said the old fellow, as he puffed
      voluminously at the principe I passed over, "I thinks of what that witness
      says in the murder trial at Socorro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What was you-all doin' in camp yourse'f,' asks the jedge of this yere
      witness, 'the day of the killin'?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which,' says the witness, oncrossin' his laigs an' lettin' on he ain't
      made bashful an' oneasy by so much attentions bein' shown hire, 'which I
      was a-eatin' of a few sardines, a-drinkin' of a few drinks of whiskey,
      a-smokin' of a few seegyars, an' a-romancin' 'round.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      After this abrupt, not to say ambiguous reminiscence, the Old Cattleman
      puffed contentedly a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What murder trial was this you speak of?" I asked. "Who had been killed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I don't reckon I ever does know who it is gets downed," he replied.
      "This yere murder trial itse'f is news to me complete. They was waggin'
      along with it when I trails into Socorro that time, an' I merely sa'nters
      over to the co't that a-way to hear what's goin' on. The jedge is sorter
      gettin' in on the play while I'm listenin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What was the last words of this yere gent who's killed?' asks the jedge
      of this witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As nearly as I keeps tabs, jedge,' says the witness, `the dyin'
      statement of this person is: "Four aces to beat."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if deceased had knowed Socorro like I does,' says the jedge, like
      he's commentin' to himse'f, 'he'd shorely realized that sech remarks is
      simply sooicidal.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Old Cattleman relapsed into silence and the smoke of the
      principe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did the trial come out?" I queried. "Was the accused found guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the trial itse'f," he replied, "don't come out. Thar's a passel of
      the boys who's come into town to see that jestice is done, an' bein' the
      round-up is goin' for'ard at the time, they nacherally feels hurried an'
      pressed for leesure. Theyalls oughter be back on the range with their
      cattle. So the fifth day, when things is loiterin' along at the trial till
      it looks like the law has hobbles on, an' the word goes round it's goin'
      to be a week yet before the jury gets action on this miscreant who's bein'
      tried, the boys becomes plumb aggravated an' wearied out that a-way; an',
      kickin' in the door of the calaboose, they searches out the felon, swings
      him to a cottonwood not otherwise engaged, an' the right prevails.
      Nacherally the trial bogs down right thar."
    </p>
    <p>
      After another season of silence and smoke, the Old Cattleman struck in
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speakn' of killin's, while I'm the last gent to go fosterin' idees of
      bloodshed, I'm some discouraged jest now by what I've been readin' in that
      paper about a dooel between some Eytalians, an' it shorely tries me the
      way them aliens plays hoss. It's obvious as stars on a cl'ar night, they
      never means fight a little bit. I abhors dooels, an' cowers from the mere
      idee. But, after all, business is business, an' when folks fights 'em the
      objects of the meetin' oughter be blood. But the way these yere European
      shorthorns fixes it, a gent shorely runs a heap more resk of becomin' a
      angel abrupt, attendin' of a Texas cake-walk in a purely social way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they ever fight dooels in the West? Why, yes&mdash;some. My mem'ry
      comes a-canterin' up right now with the details of an encounter I once
      beholds in Wolfville. Thar ain't no time much throwed away with a dooel in
      the Southwest. The people's mighty extemporaneous, an' don't go browsin'
      'round none sendin' challenges in writin', an' that sort of flapdoodle.
      When a gent notices the signs a-gettin' about right for him to go on the
      war-path, he picks out his meat, surges up, an' declar's himse'f. The
      victim, who is most likely a mighty serious an' experienced person, don't
      copper the play by makin' vain remarks, but brings his gatlin' into play
      surprisin'. Next it's bang! bang! bang! mixed up with flashes an' white
      smoke, an' the dooel is over complete. The gent who still adorns our midst
      takes a drink on the house, while St. Peter onbars things a lot an'
      arranges gate an' seat checks with the other in the realms of light.
      That's all thar is to it. The tide of life ag'in flows onward to the
      eternal sea, an' nary ripple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, this yere Wolfville dooel! `Well, it's this a-way. The day is blazin'
      hot, an' business layin' prone an' dead&mdash;jest blistered to death. A
      passel of us is sorter pervadin' 'round the dance-hall, it bein' the
      biggest an' coolest store in camp. A monte game is strugglin' for breath
      in a feeble, fitful way in the corner, an' some of us is a-watchin'; an'
      some a-settin' 'round loose a- thinkin'; but all keepin' mum an' still,
      'cause it's so hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest then some gent on a hoss goes whoopin' up the street a-yellin' an'
      a-whirlin' the loop of his rope, an' allowin' generally he's havin' a
      mighty good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who's this yere toomultuous man on the hoss?' says Enright, a- regardin'
      of him in a displeased way from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I meets him up the street a minute back,' says Dan Boggs, 'an' he allows
      he's called "The Man from Red Dog." He says he's took a day off to visit
      us, an' aims to lay waste the camp some before he goes back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "About then the Red Dog man notes old Santa Rosa, who keeps the Mexican
      baile hall, an' his old woman, Marie, a-fussin' with each other in front
      of the New York Store. They's locked horns over a drink or somethin', an'
      is pow-wowin' mighty onamiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever does this yere Mexican fam'ly mean,' says the Red Dog man,
      a-surveyin' of 'em plenty scornful, 'a-draggin' of their domestic brawls
      out yere to offend a sufferin' public for? Whyever don't they stay in
      their wickeyup an' fight, an' not take to puttin' it all over the American
      race which ain't in the play none an' don't thirst tharfor? However, I
      unites an' reeconciles this divided household easy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this the Red Dog man drops the loop of his lariat 'round the two
      contestants an' jumps his bronco up the street like it's come outen a gun.
      Of course Santa Rosa an' Marie goes along on their heads permiscus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They goes coastin' along ontil they gets pulled into a mesquite- bush,
      an' the rope slips offen the saddle, an' thar they be. We-alls goes over
      from the dance-hall, extricatin' of 'em, an' final they rounds up mighty
      hapless an' weak, an' can only walk. They shorely lose enough hide to make
      a pair of leggin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I brings 'em together like twins,' says the Red Dog man, ridin'
      back for his rope. 'I offers two to one, no limit, they don't fight none
      whatever for a month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, as it shorely looks like he's right, no one takes him. So the Red
      Dog man leaves his bluff a-hangin' an' goes into the dance- hall, a-givin'
      of it out cold an' clammy he meditates libatin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'All promenade to the bar,' yells the Red Dog man as he goes in. 'I'm a
      wolf, an' it's my night to howl. Don't 'rouse me, barkeep, with the sight
      of merely one bottle; set 'em all up. I'm some fastidious about my
      fire-water an' likes a chance to select.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we-alls takes our inspiration, an' the Red Dog man tucks his onder
      his belt an' then turns round to Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I takes it you're the old he-coon of this yere outfit?' says the Red Dog
      man, soopercillious-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which, if I ain't,' says Enright, 'it's plenty safe as a play to let
      your wisdom flow this a-way till the he-coon gets yere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If thar's anythin',' says the Red Dog man, 'I turns from sick, it's
      voylence an' deevastation. But I hears sech complaints constant of this
      yere camp of Wolfville, I takes my first idle day to ride over an' line
      things up. Now yere I be, an' while I regrets it, I finds you-alls is a
      lawless, onregenerate set, a heap sight worse than roomer. I now takes the
      notion&mdash;for I sees no other trail&mdash;that by next drink time I
      climbs into the saddle, throws my rope 'round this den of sin, an' removes
      it from the map.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nacherally,' says Enright, some sarcastic, 'in makin' them schemes you
      ain't lookin' for no trouble whatever with a band of tarrapins like us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'None whatever,' says the Red Dog man, mighty confident. 'In thirty
      minutes I distributes this yere hamlet 'round in the landscape same as
      them Greasers; which feat becomin' hist'ry, I then canters back to Red
      Dog.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' says Enright, 'it's plenty p'lite to let us know what's comin'
      this a-way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh! I ain't tellin' you none,' says the Red Dog man, 'I simply lets fly
      this hint, so any of you-alls as has got bric-a-brac he values speshul, he
      takes warnin' some an' packs it off all safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's about then when Cherokee Hall, who's lookin' on, shoulders in
      between Enright an' the Red Dog man, mighty positive. Cherokee is a heap
      sot in his idees, an' I sees right off he's took a notion ag'in the Red
      Dog man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As you've got a lot of work cut out,' says Cherokee, eyein' the Red Dog
      man malignant, 's'pose we tips the canteen ag'in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I shorely goes you,' says the Red Dog man. 'I drinks with friend, an' I
      drinks with foe; with the pard of my bosom an' the shudderin' victim of my
      wrath all sim'lar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherokee turns out a big drink an' stands a-holdin' of it in his hand. I
      wants to say right yere, this Cherokee's plenty guileful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You was namin',' says Cherokee, 'some public improvements you aims to
      make; sech as movin' this yere camp 'round some, I believes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever,' says the Red Dog man, 'an' the holycaust I 'nitiates
      is due to start in fifteen minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I've been figgerin' on you,' says Cherokee, 'an' I gives you the result
      in strict confidence without holdin' out a kyard. When you- all talks of
      tearin' up Wolfville, you're a liar an' a hoss-thief, an' you ain't goin'
      to tear up nothin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's this I hears!' yells the frenzied Red Dog man, reachin' for his
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he never gets it, for the same second Cherokee spills the glass of
      whiskey straight in his eyes, an' the next he's anguished an' blind as a
      mole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'll fool this yere human simoon up a lot,' says Cherokee, a- hurlin' of
      the Red Dog man to the floor, face down, while his nine- inch bowie shines
      in his hand like the sting of a wasp. 'I shore fixes him so he can't get a
      job clerkin' in a store,' an' grabbin' the Red Dog man's ha'r, which is
      long as the mane of a pony, he slashes it off close in one motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's a fringe for your leggin's, Nell,' remarks Cherokee, a- turnin'
      of the crop over to Faro Nell. 'Now, Doc,' Cherokee goes on to Doc Peets,
      'take this yere Red Dog stranger over to the Red Light, fix his eyes all
      right, an' then tell him, if he thinks he needs blood in this, to take his
      Winchester an' go north in the middle of the street. In twenty minutes by
      the watch I steps outen the dance-hall door a-lookin' for him. P'int him
      to the door all fair an' squar'. I don't aim to play nothin' low on this
      yere gent. He gets a chance for his ante.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets sorter accoomilates the Red Dog man, who is cussin' an'
      carryin' on scand'lous, an' leads him over to the Red Light. In a minute
      word comes to Cherokee as his eyes is roundin' up all proper, an' that
      he's makin' war-medicine an' is growin' more hostile constant, an' to heel
      himse'f. At that Cherokee, mighty ca'm, sends out for Jack Moore's
      Winchester, which is an 'eight-squar',' latest model.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, Cherokee!' says Faro Nell, beginnin' to cry, an' curlin' her arms
      'round his neck. 'I'm 'fraid he's goin' to down you. Ain't thar no way to
      fix it? Can't Dan yere settle with this Red Dog man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cert,' says Dan Boggs, 'an' I makes the trip too gleeful. Jest to spar'
      Nell's feelin's, Cherokee, an' not to interfere with no gent's little
      game, I takes your hand an' plays it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not none,' says Cherokee; 'this is my deal. Don't cry, Nellie,' he adds,
      smoothin' down her yaller ha'r. 'Folks in my business has to hold
      themse'fs ready to face any game on the word, an' they never weakens or
      lays down. An' another thing, little girl; I gets this Red Dog sharp,
      shore. I'm in the middle of a run of luck; I holds fours twice last night,
      with a flush an' a full hand out ag'in 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nell at last lets go of Cherokee's neck, an', bein' a female an' timid
      that a-way, allows she'll go, an' won't stop to see the shootin' none. We
      applauds the idee, thinkin' she might shake Cherokee some if she stays;
      an' of course a gent out shootin' for his life needs his nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the twenty minutes is up; the Red Dog man gets his rifle offen his
      saddle an' goes down the middle of the street. Turnin' up his big
      sombrero, he squar's 'round, cocks his gun, an' waits. Then Enright goes
      out with Cherokee an' stands him in the street about a hundred yards from
      the Red Dog man. After Cherokee's placed he holds up his hand for
      attention an' says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When all is ready I stands to one side an' drops my hat. You-alls fires
      at will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright goes over to the side of the street, counts 'one,' 'two,'
      'three,' an' drops his hat. Bangety! Bang! Bang! goes the rifles like the
      roll of a drum. Cherokee can work a Winchester like one of these yere
      Yankee 'larm-clocks, an' that Red Dog hold-up don't seem none behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the fifth fire the Red Dog man sorter steps for'ard an' drops his
      gun; an' after standin' onsteady for a second, he starts to cripplin' down
      at his knees. At last he comes ahead on his face like a landslide. Thar's
      two bullets plumb through his lungs, an' when we gets to him the red froth
      is comin' outen his mouth some plenteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We packs him back into the Red Light an' lays him onto a monte- table.
      Bimeby he comes to a little an' Peets asks him whatever he thinks he
      wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I wants you-alls to take off my moccasins an' pack me into the street,'
      says the Red Dog man. 'I ain't allowin' for my old mother in Missoury to
      be told as how I dies in no gin-mill, which she shorely 'bominates of 'em.
      An' I don't die with no boots on, neither.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls packs him back into the street ag'in, an' pulls away at his
      boots. About the time we gets 'em off he sags back convulsive, an' thar he
      is as dead as Santa Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What sort of a game is this, anyhow?' says Dan Boggs, who, while we
      stands thar, has been pawin' over the Red Dog man's rifle. 'Looks like
      this vivacious party's plumb locoed. Yere's his hind-sights wedged up for
      a thousand yards, an' he's been a-shootin' of cartridges with a hundred
      an' twenty grains of powder into 'em. Between the sights an' the jump of
      the powder, he's shootin' plumb over Cherokee an' aimin' straight at him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nellie,' says Enright, lookin' remorseful at the girl, who colors up an'
      begins to cry ag'in, 'did you cold-deck this yere Red Dog sport this
      a-way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm 'fraid,' sobs Nell, 'he gets Cherokee; so I slides over when
      you-alls is waitin' an' fixes his gun some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I should shorely concede you did,' says Enright. 'The way that Red
      Dog gent manip'lates his weepon shows he knows his game; an' except for
      you a-settin' things up on him, I'm powerful afraid he'd spoiled Cherokee
      a whole lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, gents,' goes on Enright, after thinkin' a while, 'I reckons
      we-alls might as well drink on it. Hist'ry never shows a game yet, an' a
      woman in it, which is on the squar', an' we meekly b'ars our burdens with
      the rest.'"

      CHAPTER IX. CHEROKEE HALL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "An' you can't schedoole too much good about him," remarked the Old
      Cattleman. Here he threw away the remnant of the principe, and, securing
      his pipe, beat the ashes there-out and carefully reloaded with cut plug.
      Inevitably the old gentleman must smoke. His tone and air as he made the
      remark quoted were those of a man whose convictions touching the one
      discussed were not to be shaken. "No, sir," he continued; "when I looks
      back'ard down the trail of life, if thar's one gent who aforetime holds
      forth in Wolfville on whom I reflects with satisfaction, it's this yere
      Cherokee Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To judge from his conduct," I said, "in the hard case of the Wilkins
      girl, as well as his remark as she left on the stage, I should hold him to
      be a person of sensibilities as well as benevolent impulse."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my purpose to coax the old gentleman to further reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benev'lent!" retorted the old man. "Which I should shore admit it! What
      he does for this yere young Wilkins female ain't a marker. Thar's the Red
      Dog man he lets out. Thar's the Stingin' Lizard's nephy; he stakes said
      yooth from infancy. 'Benev'lent!' says you. This party Cherokee is that
      benev'lent he'd give away a poker hand. I've done set an' see him give
      away his hand in a jack-pot for two hundred dollars to some gent 'cross
      the table who's organizin' to go ag'in him an' can't afford to lose. An'
      you can onderscore it; a winnin' poker hand, an' him holdin' it, is the
      last thing a thoroughbred kyard-sharp'll give away. But as I says, I sees
      this Cherokee do it when the opp'sition is settin' in hard luck an'
      couldn't stand to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How would he give his hand away? Throw it in the diskyard an' not play it
      none; jest nacherally let the gent who's needy that a-way rake in the
      chips on the low hand. Cherokee mebby does it this fashion so's he don't
      wound the feelin's of this yere victim of his gen'rosity. Thar's folks who
      turns sens'tive an' ain't out to take alms none, who's feelin's he spar's
      that a-way by losin' to 'em at poker what they declines with scorn direct.
      "'Benev'lent,' is the way you puts it! Son, 'benev'lent' ain't the word.
      This sport Cherokee Hall ain't nothin' short of char'table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speakin' wide flung an' onrestrained, Cherokee, as I mentions to you
      before, is the modestest, decentest longhorn as ever shakes his antlers in
      Arizona. He is slim an' light, an' a ondoubted kyard- sharp from his
      moccasins up. An' I never knows him to have a peso he don't gamble for.
      Nothin' common, though; I sees him one night when he sets ca'mly into some
      four-handed poker, five thousand dollars table stake, an' he's sanguine
      an' hopeful about landin' on his feet as a Cimmaron sheep. Of course times
      is plenty flush in them days, an' five thousand don't seem no sech mammoth
      sum. Trade is eager an' values high; aces-up frequent callin' for five
      hundred dollars before the draw. Still we ain't none of us makin'
      cigarettes of no sech roll as five thousand. The days ain't quite so
      halcyon as all that neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what I likes speshul in Cherokee Hall is his jedgement. He's every
      time right. He ain't talkin' much, an' he ain't needin' advice neither,
      more'n a steer needs a saddle-blanket. But when he concloodes to do
      things, you can gamble he's got it plenty right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One time this Cherokee an' Texas Thompson is comin' in from Tucson on the
      stage. Besides Cherokee an' Texas, along comes a female, close-herdin' of
      two young-ones; which them infants might have been t'rant'lers an' every
      one a heap happier. Sorter as range-boss of the whole out. fit is a lean
      gent in a black coat. Well, they hops in, an' Cherokee gives 'em the two
      back seats on account of the female an' the yearlin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My name is Jones,' says the gent in the black coat, when he gets settled
      back an' the stage is goin', I an' I'm an exhortin' evangelist. I plucks
      brands from the burnin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm powerful glad to know it,' says Texas, who likes talk. 'Them games
      of chance which has vogue in this yere clime is some various, an' I did
      think I shorely tests 'em all; but if ever the device you names is open in
      Wolfville I overlooks the same complete.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pore, sinkin' soul!' says the black-coat gent to the female; 'he's
      a-flounderin' in the mire of sin. Don't you know,' he goes on to Texas,
      'my perishin' friend, you are bein' swept downward in the river of your
      own sinful life till your soul will be drowned in the abyss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, no,' says Texas, 'I don't. I allows I'm makin' a mighty dry ford
      of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Lost! lost! lost!' says the black-coat gent, a-leanin' back like he's
      plumb dejected that a-way an' hopeless. 'It is a stiff-necked gen'ration
      an' sorely perverse a lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stage jolts along two or three miles, an' nothin' more bein' said.
      The black-coat gent he groans occasionally, which worries Texas; an' the
      two infants, gettin' restless, comes tumblin' over onto Cherokee an' is
      searchin' of his pockets for mementoes. Which this is about as refreshin'
      to Cherokee as bein' burned at the stake. But the mother she leans back
      an' smiles, an' of course he's plumb he'pless. Finally the black. coat
      gent p'ints in for another talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What is your name, my pore worm?' says the black-coat gent, addressin'
      of Texas; 'an' whatever avocation has you an' your lost companion?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I Why,' says Texas, 'this yere's Hall&mdash;Cherokee Hall. He turns faro
      in the Red Light; an',' continues Texas, a-lowerin' of his voice, 'he's as
      squar' a gent as ever counted a deck. Actooally, pard, you might not think
      it, but all that gent knows about settin' up kyards, or dealin' double, or
      anv sech sinful scheme, is mere tradition.' "'Brother,' says the female,
      bristlin' up an' tacklin' the black- coat gent, 'don't talk to them
      persons no more. Them's gamblers, an' mighty awful men;' an' with that she
      snatches away the yearlin's like they's contam'nated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is relief to Cherokee, but the young-ones howls like coyotes, an'
      wants to come back an' finish pillagin' him. But the mother she spanks
      'em, an' when Texas is goin' to give 'em some cartridges outen his belt to
      amoose 'em, she sasses him scand'lous, an' allows she ain't needin' no
      attentions from him. Then she snorts at Texas an' Cherokee contemptuous.
      The young-ones keeps on yellin' in a mighty onmelodious way, an' while
      Cherokee is ca'm an' don't seem like he minds it much, Texas gets some
      nervous. At last Texas lugs out a bottle, aimin' to compose his feelins',
      which they's some harrowed by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Well, I never!' shouts the woman; 'I shorely sees inebriates ere now,
      but at least they has the decency not to pull a bottle that a- way
    </p>
    <p>
      before a lady.' "This stampedes Texas complete, an' he throws the whiskey
    </p>
    <p>
      outen the stage an' don't get no drink. "It's along late in the mornin'
      when the stage strikes the upper end of Apache Canyon. This yere canyon
    </p>
    <p>
      is lately reckoned some bad. Nothin' ever happens on the line, but
    </p>
    <p>
      them is the days when Cochise is cavortin' 'round plenty loose, an' it's
      mighty possible to stir up Apaches any time a-layin' in the hills
    </p>
    <p>
      along the trail to Tucson. If they ever gets a notion to stand up the
      stage, they's shore due to be in this canyon; wherefore Cherokee an' Texas
      an' Old Monte who's drivin' regards it s'picious. "'Send 'em through on
      the jump, Monte,' says Cherokee, stickin' out his head. "The six hosses
      lines out at a ten-mile gait, which rattles things, an' makes the
      black-coat gent sigh, while the young-ones pours forth some appallin'
      shrieks. The female gets speshul mad at this, allowin'
    </p>
    <p>
      they's playin' it low down on her fam'ly. But she takes it out in cuffin'
      the yearlin's now an' then, jest to keep 'em yellin', an' don't say
      nothin'. "Which the stage is about half through the canyon, when up on
      both sides a select assortment of Winchesters begins to bang an' jump
      permiscus; the same goin' hand-in-hand with whoops of onusual merit. With
      the first shot Old Monte pours the leather into the team, an' them hosses
      surges into the collars like cyclones. "It's lucky aborigines ain't no
      shots. They never yet gets the phelosophy of a
    </p>
    <p>
      hind sight none, an' generally you can't reach their bullets with a
      ten-foot pole, they's that high above your head. The only thing as
    </p>
    <p>
      gets hit this time is Texas. About the beginnin', a little cloud of dust
      flies outen the shoulder of his coat, his face turns pale, an' Cherokee
      knows he's creased. "'Did they get you, Old Man?' says Cherokee, some
      anxious. "'No,' says Texas, tryin' to brace himse'f. 'I'll be
    </p>
    <p>
      on velvet ag'in in a second. I now longs, however, for that whiskey I
      hurls overboard so graceful.' "The Apaches comes tumblin' down onto the
      trail an' gives chase, a-shootin' an' a-yellin' a heap zealous. As they's
      on foot, an' as Old Monte is makin' fifteen miles an hour by now, they
      merely manages to hold their own in the race, about forty yards to the
      r'ar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This don't go on long when Cherokee, after thinkin', says to Texas, 'This
      yere is the way I figgers it, If we-alls keeps on, them Injuns is that
      fervent they runs in on us at the ford. With half luck they's due to down
      either a hoss or Monte&mdash;mebby both; in which event the stage shorely
      stops, an' it's a fight. This bein' troo, an' as I'm 'lected for war
      anyhow, I'm goin' to caper out right yere, an' pull on the baile myse'f.
      This'll stop the chase, an' between us, pard, it's about the last chance
      in the box this pore female an' her offsprings has. An' I plays it for
      'em, win or lose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them's my motives; says Texas, tryin' to pull himse'f together. 'Shall
      we take this he-shorthorn along?' An' he p'ints where them four
      tenderfoots is mixed up together in the back of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He wouldn't be worth a white chip,' says Cherokee, 'an' you-all is too
      hard hit to go, Texas, yourse'f. So take my regards to Enright an' the
      boys, an' smooth this all you know for Faro Nell. I makes the trip alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not much,' says Texas. 'My stack goes to the center, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it don't, though, 'cause Texas has bled more'n he thinks. The first
      move he makes he tips over in a faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cherokee picks up his Winchester, an', openin' the door of the stage,
      jumps plumb free, an' they leaves him thar on the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's mebby an hour later when the stage comes into Wolfville on the
      lope. Texas is still in a fog, speakin' mental, an' about bled to death;
      while them exhortin' people is outen their minds entire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In no time thar's a dozen of us lined out for Cherokee. Do we locate him?
      Which I should say we shorely discovers him. Thar's a bullet through his
      laig, an' thar he is with his back ag'in a rock wall, his Winchester to
      the front, his eyes glitterin', a-holdin' the canyon. Thar never is no
      Injun gets by him. Of course they stampedes prompt when they hears us
      a-comin', so we don't get no fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I hopes you nails one, Cherokee,' says Enright; 'playin' even on this
      yere laig they shoots.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I win once, I reckons', says Cherokee, 'over behind that big rock to the
      left.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shore enough he's got one Injun spread out; an', comin' along a little,
      Jack Moore turns up a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yere's another,' says Jack, 'which breaks even on the bullet in Texas.'

      CHAPTER X. TEXAS THOMPSON'S "ELECTION."
    </h2>
    <p>
      "An' between us," remarked the Old Cattle man, the observation being
      relevant to the subject of our conversation on the occasion of one of our
      many confabs, "between you an' me, I ain't none shore about the merits of
      what you-all calls law an' order. Now a pains-takin' an' discreet
      vig'lance committee is my notion of a bulwark. Let any outfit take a bale
      of rope an' a week off, an' if their camp ain't weeded down to right
      principles an' a quiet life at the end tharof, then I've passed my days as
      vain as any coyote which ever yelps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course thar dawns a time when Wolfville has to come to it, same as
      others. They takes to diggin' for copper; an' they builds the Bird Cage
      Op'ry House, an' puts in improvements general. We even culminates in a
      paper, which Doc Peets assures us is the flower of our progress.
      Nacherally on the heels of all them outbursts we gives up our simple
      schemes, organizes, an' pulls off an 'lection. But as Old Man Enright is
      made alcalde tharby, with Jack Moore marshal, the jolt is not severe nor
      the change so full of notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not long prior to these yere stampedes into a higher moonicipal
      life, however, when quite a b'ilin' of us is in the Red Light discussin'
      some sech future. Our rival, Red Dog, is allowin' it's goin' to have a
      mayor or somethin', an' we sorter feels like our hands is forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'For myse'f,' says Old Man Enright, when the topic is circ'latin', with
      the whiskey followin' suit, an' each gent is airin' his idees an' paintin'
      his nose accordin' to his taste, 'for myse'f, I can see it comin'. Thar's
      to be law yere an' 'lections; an' while at first it's mighty likely both
      is goin' to turn out disturbin' elements, still I looks on their approach
      without fear. Wolfville is too strong, an' Wolfville intelligence is too
      well founded, to let any law loco it or set it to millin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Still,' says Dan Boggs, 'I must remark I prefers a dooly authorized band
      of Stranglers. A vig'lance committee gets my game right along. They's more
      honest than any of these yere lawsharps who's 'lected to be a jedge; an'
      they's a heap more zealous, which last is important.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Boggs is right,' replies Enright. 'It may not become me, who is head of
      the local body of that sort, to make boasts of the excellence of a
      vig'lance committee; but I ain't bluffin' on a four- flush when I
      challenges any gent to put his tongue to an event where a vig'lance
      committee stretches a party who ain't in need tharof; or which goes
      wastin' its lariats on the desert air. I puts it to you- alls without heat
      or pride, gents; Jedge Lynch is right every time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Put me down,' says Doc Peets, at the same time makin' signs for the
      barkeep to remember his mission on earth, 'put me down as coincidin' in
      them sentiments. An' I says further, that any party who's lookin' for the
      place where the bad man is scarce, an' a law- abidin' gent has the fullest
      liberty, pegged out to the shorest safetytood, let him locate where he
      finds the most lynchin's, an' where a vig'lance committee is steadily
      engaged discriminatin' 'round through the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which a camp thus provided is a model of heavenly peace.'
    </p>

"'You can
 gamble, if anybody's plumb aware of these yore trooths, it's me,'
says Texas Thompson.
</pre>
    <p>
      'When I'm down in the South Paloduro country, workin' a passel of Bar-K-7
      cattle, I aids in an effort to 'lect a jedge an' institoot reg'lar
      shore-'nough law; an' the same comes mighty near leavin' the entire hamlet
      a howlin' waste. It deciminates a heap of our best citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere misguided bluff comes to pass peculiar; an' I allers allows if
      it ain't for the onforeseen way wherein things stacks up, an' the muddle
      we-alls gets into tryin' to find a trail, the Plaza Paloduro would have
      been a scene of bleatin' peace that day, instead of a stric'ly
      corpse-an'-cartridge occasion. The death rate rises to that degree in fact
      that the next roundup is shy on men; an' thar ain't enough cartridges in
      camp, when the smoke blows away, to be seed for a second crop. On the
      squar', gents, that 'lection day on the South Paloduro was what you-alls
      might term a massacre, an' get it right every time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, what of this yere toomultuous 'lection?' demands Dave Tutt, who
      gets impatient while Texas refreshes himse'f in his glass. 'You- all
      reminds me a mighty sight, Texas, of the Tucson preacher who pulls his
      freight the other day. They puts it to him, the Tucson folks do, that he
      talks an' he talks, but he don't p'int out; an' he argufies an' he
      argufies, but he never shows wherein. A party who's goin' to make a
      pulpit-play, or shine in Arizona as a racontoor, has done got to cult'vate
      a direct, incisive style.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all c'rect,' remarks Texas, some savage, as he recovers his nose
      outen his glass; 'never you fret me none about my style not bein'
      incisive. Thar be other plays where any gent who comes puttin' it all over
      me with roode an' intemp'rate remarks will find me plenty incisive; not to
      say some soon:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yere!' interrupts Enright, quick an' sharp. 'This is plumb outside the
      line. Texas ain't got no call to wake up so malignant over what's most
      likely nothin' worse than humor on Tutt's part; an', Tutt, it ain't up to
      you none neither, to go spurrin' Texas in the shoulder in the midst of
      what I'm yere to maintain is a mighty thrillin' narration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Texas is good people,' says Dave, 'an' the last gent with which I
      thirsts to dig up the war-axe. Which I'm proud to be his friend; an' I
      means no offense when I su'gests that he whirl a smaller loop when he
      onbosoms himse'f of a tale. I yere tenders Texas my hand, assurin' of him
      that I means my language an' ain't holdin' out nothin'. Shake!' An' at
      this Dave reaches his pistol-hand to Texas Thompson, an' the same is
      seized prompt an' friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`This yere is my fault,' says Texas. 'I reckons now my wife recoverin'
      that Laredo divorce I'm mentionin' to you-alls, sorter leaves me a heap
      petulant, that a-way. But to go back to this war- jig I was relatin' about
      down at Plaza Paloduro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's this a-way: No, Nellie; thar's no female in it. This yere grows
      from a business transaction; an' the effort tharfrom to improve on present
      conditions, institoot a reign of law, an' lect a jedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the comin' of a miscreant named Cimmaron Pete, from some'ers over
      near the 'Doby Walls, is the beginnin' of the deal. This Cimmaron Pete
      comes trailin' in one day; an' a shorthorn called Glidden, who runs a
      store at the ford, comes ropin' at Cimmaron Pete to race ponies. "'"What
      for stakes do you-all aim to race for?" demands this Cimmaron Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"I'll run you for hoss an' saddle," says Glidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Say hoss ag'in hoss," says Cimmaron Pete, "an' I'm liable to go you.
      Saddles is hard to get, an' I won't resk mine. Ponies, however, is easy. I
      can get 'em every moonlight night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When them sports is racin',&mdash;which the run is to be a quarter of a
      mile, only they never finishes,&mdash;jest as Cimmaron begins to pull
      ahead, his pony bein' a shade suddener than Glidden's, whatever does the
      latter do but rope this Cimmaron Pete's pony by the feet an' down him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's shore fine work with a lariat, but it comes high for Glidden. For,
      as he stampedes by, this Cimmaron turns loose his six-shooter from where
      he's tangled up with his bronco on the ground; an' as the first bullet
      gets Glidden in the back of his head, his light goes out like a candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When the committee looks into the play they jestifies this Cimmaron.
      "While on the surface," they says, "the deal seems a little florid; still,
      when a gent armed with nothin' but a cold sense of jestice comes to
      pirootin' plumb through the affair with a lantern, he's due to emerge a
      lot with the conviction that Glidden's wrong." So Cimmaron is free in a
      minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But thar's Glidden's store! Thar's nobody to claim it; thar bein' no
      fam'ly to Glidden nohow; not even a hired man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Which, as it seems to be a case open to doubt," observes this yere
      Cimmaron, "I nacherally takes this Glidden party's store an' deals his
      game myse'f."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It ain't much of a store; an' bein' as the rest of us is havin' all
      we-alls can ride herd on for ourse'fs, no gent makes objections, an'
      Cimmaron turns himse'f loose in Glidden's store, an' begins to sell things
      a whole lot. He's shorely doin' well, I reckons, when mebby it's a week
      later he comes chargin' over to a passel of us an' allows he wants the
      committee to settle some trouble which has cut his trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"It's about the debts of this yere Glidden, deceased," says Cimmaron. "I
      succeeds to the business of course; which it's little enough for departed
      ropin' my pony that time. But you-alls can gamble I ain't goin' 'way back
      on this yere dead person's trail, an' settle all his gray an' hoary
      indebtnesses. Would it be right, gents? I puts it to you-alls on the
      squar'; do I immerse myse'f, I'd like for to be told, in deceased's
      liabilities merely for resentin' of his wrongs ag'in me with my gun? If a
      gent can go blindly shootin' himse'f into bankruptcy that a-way, the
      American gov'ment is a rank loser, an' the State of Texas is plumb played
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we-alls proceeds to ferret into this yere myst'ry, we finds thar's a
      sharp come up from Dallas who claims that Cimmaron's got to pay him what
      Glidden owes. This yere Dallas party puts said indebtednesses at five
      stacks of blues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' this yere longhorn's got 'em to make good, "says the Dallas sharp,
      p'intin' at Cimmaron, "'cause he inherits the store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now, whatever do you-alls think of that?" says Cimmaron, appealin' to
      us. "Yere I've told this perverse sport that Glidden's done cashed in an'
      quit; an' now he lays for me with them indebtednesses. It shorely wearies
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It don't take the vig'lance committee no time to agree it ain't got
      nothin' to say in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'" It's only on killin's, an' hoss-rustlin's, an' sim'lar breaks."
      explains Old Monroe, who's chief of the Paloduro Stranglers, "where
      we-alls gets kyards. We ain't in on what's a mere open-an'-shet case of
      debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But this Dallas sharp stays right with Cimmaron. He gives it out cold
      he's goin' to c'lect. He puts it up he'll shore sue Cimmaron a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You-alls don't mean to say thar ain't no jedge yere?" remarks the Dallas
      sharp, when Old Monroe explains we ain't organized none for sech games as
      law cases. "Well, this yere Plaza Paloduro is for certain the locodest
      camp of which I ever cuts the trail! You-alls better get a hustle on right
      now an' 'lect a jedge. If I goes back to Dallas an' tells this story of
      how you-alls ain't got no jedge nor no law yere, they won't let this Plaza
      Paloduro get close enough to 'em in business to hand 'em a ripe peach. If
      thar's enough sense in this camp to make bakin'-powder biscuit, you-alls
      will have a jedge 'lected ready for me to have law cases with by
      second-drink time to-morrow mornin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'After hangin' up this bluff the Dallas sharp, puttin' on a heap of
      hawtoor an' dog, walks over to the tavern ag'in, an' leaves us to size up
      the play at our lcesure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What this obdurate party from Dallas says," finally remarks Old Monroe,
      "is not with. out what the Comanches calls tum-tum. Thar's savey an'
      jestice in them observations. It's my idee, that thar bein' no jedge yere,
      that a-way, to make a money round-up for a gent when his debtor don't make
      good, is mighty likely a palin' offen our fence. I shorely thinks we
      better rectify them omissions an' 'lect a jedge at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I'm opposed to these proceedin's," interrupts Cimmaron. "I'm plumb
      adverse to co'ts. Them law-wolves gets into 'em, an' when they can't find
      no gate to come at you, they ups an' pushes down a panel of fence, an'
      lays for you, cross-lots. I'm dead ag'in these proceedin's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'See yere," says Old Monroe, turnin' on this Cimmaron," you-all is
      becomin' too apparent in this camp; what I might describe as a heap too
      obvious. Now if you gets your stack in ag'in when it ain't your turn; or
      picks up anybody's hand but your own, I'll find a short way of knockin'
      your horns off. You don't seem gifted enough to realize that you're lucky
      to be alive right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bar Cimmaron, who lapses into silence after Old Monroe gives him notice,
      the entire camp lines up fav'rable on the idee to 'lect a jedge. They
      sends over to the corral an' gets a nose-bag for to deposit the votes; an'
      it's decided that Old Monroe an' a Cross-Z party named Randall has got to
      do the runnin'. Randall is plenty p'lite, an' allows he don't want to be
      jedge none nohow, an' says, give it to Old Monroe; but the latter gent,
      who is organizin' the play, insists that it wouldn't be legal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Thar's got to be two gents to do the runnin'," so Old Monroe says, "or
      it don't go. The 'lection ain't legal that a-way onless thar's two
      candidates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They puts Bronco Charlie an' a sport named Ormsby in to be 'lection
      supervisors. They was to hold the nose-bag; an' as votes is dropped in,
      they's to count 'em out accordin' to Hoyle, so we-alls can tell where the
      play's headin'. Bronco Charlie is jedge for Randall, an' Ormsby fronts up
      all sim'lar for Old Monroe. The 'lection we-alls decides to hold in the
      Lone Star Saloon, so's to be conducted with comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Make your game, now, gents," says Old Monroe, when everythin' is
      shorely ready. "Get in your votes. These yere polls is open for one hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"One for Randall," says Bronco Charlie as Old Monroe votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"An' one for Old Monroe," remarks Ormsby when Randall votes next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This gives the deal tone to have Randall an' Old Monroe p'int out by
      votin' for each other that a-way, and thar ain't one of us who don't feel
      more respectable by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's the opinion of level-headed gents even yet, that the Plaza Paloduro
      could have pulled off this 'lection an' got plumb away, an' never had no
      friction, if it ain't for a Greaser from San Antonio who tries to ring in
      on us. Thar's twenty-one of us has voted, an' it stands nine for Randall
      an' twelve for Old Monroe; when up lopes this yere Mexican an' allows he's
      locoed to vote. "'Who do you-all think you're goin' to vote for?" asks
      Ormsby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Senior Monroe," says the Mexican, p'intin' at Old Monroe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Stop this deal," yells Bronco Charlie, "'I challenges that vote.
      Mexicans is barred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which Mexicans is not barred," replies Ormsby. "An' the vote of this
      yere enlightened maverick from south of the Rio Grande goes. Thirteen for
      Old Monroe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Twelve for Old Monroe," remonstrates Bronco Charlie, feelin' for his
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thirteen for Old Monroe," retorts Ormsby, as his Colt's comes into
      action an' he busts Bronco's arm at the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As his obstinacy has destroyed the further efficiency of my colleague,"
      goes on Ormsby, as he shakes down the ballots in the nose-bag, "I'll now
      conduct these yere polls alone. Gents who haven't voted will please come
      a-runnin'. As I states a moment ago, she stands thirteen for Old Monroe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' I says she's twelve for Old Monroe," shouts Red River Tom, crowdin'
      for'ard. "'You-all can't ring in Mexicans an' snake no play on us. This
      yere 'lection's goin' to be on the squar', or it's goin' to come off in
      the smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'With this, Red River, who's been sorter domineerin' at Ormsby with his
      six-shooter while he's freein' his mind, slams her loose. Red River
      over-shoots, an' Ormsby downs him with a bullet in his laig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thirteen for Old Monroe," says Ormsby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But that's where the 'lection ends. Followin' the subsidence of Red
      River Tom, the air is as full of lead as a bag of bullets. Through the
      smoke, an' the flashes, an' the noise, you can hear Ormsby whoopin'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thirteen for Old Monroe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You can gamble Ormsby's as squar' a 'lection jedge as any gent could
      ask. You gets a play for your money with Ormsby; but he dies the next day,
      so he never is 'lection jedge no more. Five gents gets downed, an' a whole
      corralfull is hurt. I, myse'f, reaps some lead in the shoulder; an' even
      at that I never goes nearer than the suburbs of the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No; Cimmaron Pete claws off all sound, an' no new holes in him. But as
      the Dallas party, who comes caperin' over with the first shot, is layin'
      at the windup outside the Lone Star door, plumb defunct, thar's an end to
      the root of the disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The 'lection itse'f is looked on as a draw. Old Monroe allows that, all
      things considered, he don't regard himse'f as 'lected none; and Randall,
      who a doctor is feelin' 'round in for a bullet at the time, sends over
      word that he indorses Old Monroe's p'sition; an' that as long as the
      Dallas sharp hits the trail after Glidden, an' is tharby able to look
      after his debts himse'f, he, Randall, holds it's no use disturbin' of a
      returned sereenity, an' to let everythin' go as it lays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' that,' concloods Texas Thompson, as he reaches for his licker, 'is
      what comes of an effort at law an' order in Plaza Paloduro. I ain't
      over-statin' it, gents, when I says, that that 'lection leaves me plumb
      gun-shy for over a year.'"

      The Old Cattleman's face was full of an earnest, fine sincerity. It was
      plain, too, that my question nettled the old fellow a bit; as might a
      doubt cast at an idol. But the sharpness had passed from his tone when he
      resumed
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not only is Jack long on sand that a-way, but he's plumb loaded with what
      you-alls calls 'nitiative. Leastwise that's what one of these yere
      fernologists allows, who straggles into camp an' goes to thumbin' our
      bumps one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which this young person,' says the bumpsharp, while his fingers is
      caperin' about on Jack's head, I is remarkable for his 'nitiative. He's
      the sort of gent who builds his fire before he gets his wood; an' issues
      more invites to drink than he receives. Which his weakness, speakin'
      general, is he overplays.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which this yere bump party might have gone wrong in his wagers a heap of
      times; but he shorely calls the turn on Jack when he says he's some strong
      on 'nitiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' it's this yere proneness for the prematoor, an' nacheral willin'ness
      to open any pot that a-way, that makes Jack sech a slam- up offishul.
      Bein' full of 'nitiative, like this fernologist states, Jack don't idle
      along ontil somethin's happened. Not much; he abates it in the bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once when most of the outfit's over in Tucson, an' Jack is sorter holdin'
      down the camp alone, a band of rustlers comes trackin' in, allowin'
      they'll run Wolfville some. Which, that's where Jack's 'nitiative shows up
      big. He goes after 'em readily, like they's antelope. Them hold-ups is a
      long majority over Jack, an' heeled; but that Jack stands thar&mdash;right
      up ag'in the iron&mdash;an' he tells 'em what he thinks an' why he thinks
      it for; makes his minority report onto 'em all free, like he outnumbers
      'em two to one; an' winds up by backin' the game with his gun in a way
      that commands confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You-alls hears my remarks,' he says at the close, briefly flashin' his
      six-shooters on the outfit; 'thar ain't no band of bad men in Arizona can
      tree this town an' me informed. Now go slow, or I'll jest stretch a few of
      you for luck. It's sech consoomin' toil, a- diggin' of sepulchers in this
      yere rock-ribbed landscape, or I'd do it anyhow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' tharupon them rustlers, notin' Jack's got the drop on 'em, kicks up a
      dense cloud of dust an is seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But bein' replete with sand an' 'nitiative, that a-way, don't state all
      thar is good of Jack. Let any pore, he'pless party cut Jack's trail, an'
      he's plumb tender. On sech times Jack's a dove; leastwise he's a dove a
      whole lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One hot afternoon, Enright an' Doc Peets is away about some cattle I
      reckons. Which the rest of us is noomerous enough; an' we're sorter
      revolvin' 'round the post-office, a-waitin' for Old Monte an' the stage.
      Yere she comes, final, a-rattlin' an' a-creakin'; that old drunkard Monte
      a-poppin' of his whip, the six hosses on the canter, an' the whole
      sheebang puttin' on more dog than a Mexican officer of revenoo. When the
      stage draws up, Old Monte throws off the mailbags an' the Wells-Fargo box,
      an' gets down an' opens the door. But nobody emerges out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, I'm a coyote! ' says Monte, a heap disgusted, `wherever is the
      female?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we-alls peers into the stage an' thar's only a baby, with mebby a
      ten-months' start down this vale of tears, inside; an' no mother nor
      nothin' along. Jack Moore, jest as I says when I begins, reaches in an'
      gets him. The baby ain't sayin' nothin', an' sorter takes it out in
      smilin' on Jack; which last pleases him excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He knows me for a hundred dollars!' says Jack. 'I'm an Apache if he
      ain't allowin' he knows me! Wherever did you get him, Monte?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Give me a drink,' says Monte, p'intin' along into the Red Light. 'This
      yere makes me sick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After Old Monte gets about four fingers of carnation onder his belt, he
      turns in an' explains as how the mother starts along in the stage all
      right enough from Tucson. The last time he sees her, so he puts it up, is
      at the last station back some twenty miles in the hills; an' he s'poses
      all the time later, she's inside ridin' herd on her progeny, ontil now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't reckon,' says Old Monte, lookin' gloomy-like at the infant,
      'that lady is aimin' to saw this yore young-one onto the stage company
      none?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't upset your whiskey frettin' about the company,' says Jack,
      a-plantin' of the infant on the bar, while we-alls crowds in for a look at
      him. `The camp'll play this hand; an' the company ain't goin' to be in it
      a little bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I wish Enright an' Peets was yere,' says Cherokee Hall, 'to be heard
      hereon; which I shore deems this a grave occasion. Yere we- alls finds
      ourse'fs possessed of an onexpected child of tender years; an' the
      question nacheral enough is, whatever'll we do with it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Let's maverick it,' says Dan Boggs, who's a mighty good man, but
      onthinkful that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' says Cherokee; 'its mother'll come hoppin' along to-morrow,
      a-yellin'. This yere sot Monte has jest done drove off an' left her
      some'ers up the trail; she'll come romancin' along in time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Meanwhile,' says Jack, 'the infant's got to be took care of, to which
      dooty I volunteers. Thar's a tenderfoot a-sleepin' in the room back of the
      dance-hall, an' he's that 'feminate an' effeet, he's got a shore-'nough
      bed an' some goose-ha'r pillers; which the same I do yereby confiscate to
      public use to take care of this yearlin'. Is the sentiment pleasin'?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Jack's scheme is right,' says Boggs; 'an' I'm present to announce he's
      allers right. Let the shorthorn go sleep onder a mesquite-bush; it'll do
      him good a whole lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm some doobersome of this play,' says Cherokee. 'Small infants is
      mighty myster'ous people, an' no livin' gent is ever onto their game an'
      able to foresee their needs. Do you-all reckon now you can take care of
      this yere young-one, Jack? Be you equal to it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Take care of a small baby like this' says Jack, plenty scornful; 'which
      the same ain't weighin' twenty pounds? Well, it'll be some funny if I
      can't. I could break even with him if he's four times as big. All I asks
      is for you-alls to stand by in crisises an' back the play; an', that
      settled, you can go make side bets we-alls comes out winners on the deal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ain't absolootly shore,' says Dave Tutt, 'bein' some shy of practice
      with infants myse'f, but jedgin' by his lookin' smooth an' silky, I offers
      fifty dollars even he ain't weaned none yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I won't bet none on his bein' weaned complete; says Jack, 'but I'll hang
      up fifty he drinks outen a bottle as easy as Old Monte!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'll go you once,' says Tutt; 'it's fifty dollars even he grows
      contemptuous at a bottle, an' disdains it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which we-alls talks it over an' decides that Jack's to nurse said infant;
      after which a passel of us proceed's to make a procession for the
      tenderfoot's bed, which he shorely resigns without a struggle. We packs it
      back to Jack; an' Cherokee Hall an' Boggs then goes over to the corral an'
      lays for a goat to milk her. This yere goat is mighty reluctant, an'
      refuses to enter into the sperit of the thing; but they swings an' rastles
      with her, makes their p'int right along, an' after a frightful time comes
      back with'most a dipper-full.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all right,' says Jack, who's done camped in a room back of the
      Red Light, 'now hop out an' tell the barkeep to give you a pint bottle.
      We-alls has this yere game payin' div'dends in two minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack gets his bottle an' fills her up with goat's milk; an' makes a
      stopper outen cotton cloth an' molasses for the infant to draw it through.
      Which it's about this time the infant puts up a yell, an' refuses peace
      ag'in till Jack gives him his six-shooter to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which shows my confidence in him,' says Jack. 'Thar's only a few folks
      left I'll pass my gun to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack gets along with him first-rate, a-feedin' of him the goat's milk,
      which he goes for with avidity; tharby nettin' Jack that fifty from Dave
      Tutt. Boggs builds a fire so Jack keeps the milk warm. Jack turns loose
      that earnest he don't even go for no grub; jest nacherally has 'em pack it
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We-alls'll have to stand night gyards on this yere foundlin' to- night,
      I reckons?" asks Boggs of Jack, when he's bringin' Jack things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I s'pose most likely we'll have to make a play that a-way,' says Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'All right,' says Boggs, tappin' his shirt with his pistol-finger;
      'you-all knows me an' Cherokee. We're in on this yere any time you says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So a band of us sorter camps along with Jack an' the infant ontil mebby
      it's second-drink time at night. The infant don't raise the war-yell once;
      jest takes it out in goat's milk; an' in laughin', an' playin' with Jack's
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Excuse me, gents,' finally says Jack, mighty dignified, 'but I've been
      figgerin' this thing, an' I allows it's time to bed this yere young-one
      down for the night. If you-alls will withdraw some, I'll see how near I
      comes to makin' runnin' of it. Stay within whoopin' distance, though; so
      if he tries to stampede or takes to millin' I can get he'p.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls lines out an' leaves Jack an' the infant, an' turns in on faro
      an' poker an' sim'lar devices which is bein' waged in the Red Light. Mebby
      it's an hour when Jack comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Boggs,' he says; 's'pose you-all sets in an' plays my hand a minute with
      that infant child, while I goes over an' adjourns them frivolities in the
      dance-hall. It looks like this yere camp is speshul toomultuous to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boggs goes in with the infant, an' Jack proceeds to the baile house an'
      states the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't want to onsettle the reg'lar programme,' says Jack, 'but this
      yere young-one I'm responsible for, gets that engaged in the sounds of
      these yere revels, it don't look like he's goin' to sleep none. So if
      you-alls will call the last waltz, an' wind her up for to-night, it'll
      shorely be a he'p. The kid's mother'll be yere by sun-up; which her advent
      that a-way alters the play all 'round, an' matters then goes back to old
      lines.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Enough said,' says Jim Hamilton, who runs the dance-hall. 'You can
      gamble this temple of mirth ain't layin' down on what's right, an'
      tonight's shindig closes right yere. All promenade to the bar. We takes a
      drink on the house, quits, an' calls it a day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Jack comes back, a heap grave with his cares, an' relieves Boggs;
      who's on watch, straddled of a chair, a-eyein' of the infant, who,
      a-settin' up ag'in a goose-ha'r piller, is likewise a-eyein' of Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He's a 'way up good infant, Jack,' says Boggs, givin' up his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You can bet your life he's a good infant,' says Jack; 'but it shore
      looks like he don't aim to turn in an' slumber none. Mebby the goat's milk
      is too invigeratin' for 'him, an' keeps him awake that a-way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "About another hour goes by, an' out comes Jack into the Red Light ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I ain't aimin' to disturb you-alls none,' he says, 'but, gents, if
      you-alls could close these games yere, an' shet up the store, I'll take it
      as a personal favor. He can hear the click of the chips, an' it's too many
      for him. Don't go away; jest close up an' sorter camp 'round quiet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which we-alls does as Jack says; closes the games, an' then sets 'round
      in our chairs an' keeps quiet, a-waitin' for the infant to turn in. A
      half-hour later Jack appears ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It ain't no use, gents,' he says, goin' back of the bar an' gettin' a
      big drink; 'that child is onto us. He won't have it. You can gamble, he's
      fixed it up with himse'f that he ain't goin' to sleep none to-night. I
      allows it's 'cause he's among rank strangers, an' he figgers it's a good
      safe play to lookout his game for himse'f.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I wonder couldn't we sing him to sleep,' says Cherokee Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nothin' ag'in a try,' says Jack, some desp'rate, wipin' his lips after
      the drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'S'pose we-alls gives him "The Dyin' Ranger" an' "Sandy Land" for an hour
      or so, an' see,' says Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In we trails. Cherokee lines up on one side of the infant, an' Jack on
      t'other; an' the rest of us takes chairs an' camps 'round, We starts in
      an' shore sings him all we knows; an' we keeps it up for hours. All the
      time, that child is a-settin' thar, a-battin' his eyes an' a-starin',
      sleepless as owls. The last I remembers is Boggs's voice on 'Sandy Land'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"'Great big taters on sandy land,
 Get thar, Eli, if you can.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "The next thing I'm aware of, thar's a whoop an' a yell outside. We- alls
      wakes up&mdash;all except the infant, who's wide awake all along&mdash;
      an' yere it is; four o'clock in the mornin', an' the mother has come.
      Comes over on a speshul buckboard from the station where that old
      inebriate, Monte, drove off an' left her. Well, son, everybody's plumb
      willin' an' glad to see her. An' for that matter, splittin' even, so's the
      infant."

      CHAPTER XII. THE MAN FROM YELLOWHOUSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "That's straight, son; you shorely should have seen Jack Moore," continued
      the Old Cattleman, after a brief pause, as he hitched his chair into a
      comfortable position; "not seein' Jack is what any gent might call
      deeprivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back in the old days," he went on, "Jack Moore, as I relates, is
      kettle-tender an' does the rope work of the Stranglers. Whatever is the
      Stranglers? Which you asks Borne late. I mentions this assembly a heap
      frequent yeretofore. Well, some folks calls 'ern the 'vig'lance
      committee'; but that's long for a name, so in Wolfville we allers allooded
      to 'em as `Stranglers.' This yere is brief, an' likewise sheds some light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Jack Moore&mdash;which I'm proud to say he's my friend&mdash;I
      reckons is the most pro bono publico gent in the Southwest. He's out to do
      anythin' from fight to fiddle at a dance, so's it's a public play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' then his idees about his dooties is wide. He jest scouts far an'
      near, an' don't pay no more heed to distance an' fatigue than a steer does
      to cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'A offishul," says Jack, 'who don't diffuse himse'f 'round none, an'
      confines his endeavors to his own bailiwick, is reestricted an'
      oneffectooal, an' couldn't keep down crime in a village of prairie- dogs.'
      An' then he'd cinch on his saddle, an' mebby go curvin' off as far north
      as the Flint Hills, or east to the Turkey-track.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right; when it comes to bein' active, Jack is what you might call
      an all-round seelection. An' clean strain? Game as hornets. Never knowed
      him to quit anythin' in his life&mdash;not even whiskey. I says to him
      myse'f one time: 'Jack; whyever don't you renig on whiskey? Looks like
      it's sorter gettin' behind you some, ain't it? Some day mebby it outholds
      you when you can't stand to lose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sometimes I thinks I'll pass it up, myse'f,' says Jack, 'but don't you
      know, I can't do it. I'm too sperited, that a-way, an' chivalrous. That's
      whatever! I'm too chivalrous.' An' I shore reckons he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as for doin' his dooty! Which the same is simply relaxation to Jack
      Moore. I recalls one instance speshul. One day thar comes trailin' along
      into Wolfville a party from down 'round Yallerhouse some'ers. This yere
      Yallerhouse gent looks disperited an' off color as to health. But of
      course we-alls don't refer none to it; for whether this stranger's sick or
      well is his business, not ours; leastwise in its first stages. This yere's
      before Doc Peets inhabits Wolfville or he'd informed us touchin' this
      party's that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the Yallerhouse gent tracks along into the Red Light, an' tells the
      barkeep to set out the nose-paint. He drinks alone, not invitin' of the
      pop'lace, whereby we knows for shore he's offen his feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, after he corrals his forty drops, this invalid camps down in one
      corner of the stage station, an' next mornin' he wakes up outen his head
      an' plumb locoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere Yallerhouse man,' says Dan Boggs, comin' along into the Red
      Light about first-drink time the same mornin', an' speakin' general, 'is
      what conserv'tive opinion might call "some sick." I stops a minute ago an'
      asks him how he's stackin' up like, but it ain't no use. He's plumb off
      his mental reservation, an' crazy as a woman's watch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever do you allow is the matter of him, Boggs?' asks Old Man
      Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Smallpox,' says Boggs, mighty confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Smallpox!' repeats Enright; 'be you shore?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's what I says,' answers Boggs; 'an' you can gamble my long suit is
      pickin' out smallpox every time. I knows the signal smoke like my own
      campfire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, see yere,' says Dave Tutt, who's come in, 'I jest now rounds up
      them symptoms of this Yallerhouse gent; an' talkin' of smallpox, I offers
      a hundred dollars even he ain't got no smallpox. Bein' out solely for
      legit'mate sport,' continues Tutt, 'an' not aimin' to offend Boggs none, I
      willin'ly calls it fifty to one hundred he ain't got nothin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I takes both bets,' says Boggs, 'an' deems 'em easy. Which both is
      like robbin' a bird's-nest. Yere's the circ'latin' medium. Thar; cover it
      an' file it away with the barkeep to wait results.' So Tutt an' Boggs
      makes their bets mighty eager, an' the barkeep holds the stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as it gets blown through Wolfville this Yallerhouse party has
      smallpox, everybody comes canterin' over to the Red Light, gets a drink,
      an' wants to hold a mass meetin' over it. By partic'lar request Enright
      takes the chair an' calls 'em to order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere meetin',' says Enright, meanwhile beatin' with the butt of his
      six-shooter on the poker-table, 'is some sudden an' permiscus; but the
      objects is easy an' plain. We-alls convenes ourse'fs to consider the
      physical condition of this party from Yallerhouse, which report says is
      locoed an' can't talk none for himself. To make this inquiry a success,
      we-alls oughter see this Yallerhouse gent; an' as thar is fewer of him
      than of us, I app'ints Jack Moore, Dan Boggs, an' Short Creek Dave, a
      committee, of three, to bring him before us in a body. Pendin' the return
      of the committee the meetin' will take a drink with the chair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "In about no time back comes the outfit, packin' the Yallerhouse man all
      easy enough in a blanket, an' spreads him out on the floor. He looks
      sorter red 'round in spots, like somethin's been stingin' of him, but it's
      evident, as Boggs says, he's locoed. He lays thar, rollin' his eyes an'
      carryin' on to himse'f, but he don't address the chair or offer to take no
      part in the meetin'. Enright quaffs his drink all slow an' dignified, an'
      gazes at the Yallerhouse man on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, gents,' says Enright at last, settin' down his glass, an' givin'
      the poker-table a little tap with his gun, 'yere's the party, an' the
      question is now: "What's he got?" Do I hear any remarks?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bein' in the lines, Mister Pres'dent,' says Boggs, 'of previous
      assertion, an' for the purpose of bringin' the question squar' before this
      house, I now moves you this yere Yallerhouse party has the smallpox. I
      ain't aimin' herein at playin' it low on Tutt, an' su'gests that the
      chair, in puttin' the question, also informs the meetin' as to them
      wagers; which the money tharof is now in the war- bags of the barkeep. I
      believes in givin' every gent all necessary light wherein to make up his
      mind; an', as I says, to open the game all logical, I ag'in moves this
      Yallerhouse man has the smallpox.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yo tambien,' yells a Mexican over near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Put that Greaser out!' shouts Enright, at the same time bangin' the
      table. 'This ain't no international incident at all, an' nothin' but the
      clean-strain American wolf is eligible to howl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Greaser goes out on his saddle-colored head, an' Enright puts Boggs's
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Every gent,' says Enright, 'in favor of this Yallerhouse man havin' the
      smallpox, say "Aye"; contrary "No."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody shouts 'Aye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the "Ayes" has it unanimous,' says Enright. 'The Yallerhouse party
      has the smallpox, an' the next chicken on the parliamentary roost is the
      question: "Whatever is to be done to make this yere malady a success?" Is
      thar any su'gestions?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mister Pres'dent,' says Texas Thompson, risin' in his place, 'I've done
      took no hand in these proceedin's so far, through ignorance of the
      purposes of this yere convocation. Said purposes bein' now for the first
      time lined out all right in my mind, an' the question bein', "What's to be
      done with our captive?" I asks your indulgence. My first idee is that our
      dooty an' our path is plain; the same bein' simply to take a lariat an'
      hang this Yallerhouse person to the dance-hall windmill; but this course,
      on second thought, seems prematoor an' the offsprings of nacheral impulse.
      Still, somethin' must be done; an' while my mind is by no means cl'ar, I
      su'gests we turn the gent over to Jack Moore, which is the marshal hereof,
      to ride herd on him till further orders; an' I makes a motion to that
      effect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Seconds the motion!' says Short Creek Dave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You don't have to put that motion, Mister Pres'dent,' says Jack; 'I've
      been cirelin' the idee some myse'f, an' I reckons it's my dooty to take
      charge of this Yallerhouse gent. You can bet anythin' which gets sawed
      onto me as my dooty goes, an' don't make no doubt about it. Yere's how I
      trails out on this: If it ain't my dooty to take care of this person,
      whose dooty is it? 'Tain't nobody's. Tharfore I plays the hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the same bein' eminent satisfactory,' says Dave Tutt, risin', as
      if he thinks of somethin' speshul, 'I now inquires whether this yere is
      held decisive of them bets I makes with Boggs. I holdin', meanwhile,
      contrary views emphatic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This bein' a question of priv'lege,' says Enright, 'the chair will
      answer it. These proceedin's decides your bets with Boggs, an' the barkeep
      pays Boggs the dinero. This is a gov'ment of the people, for the people,
      by the people, an' founded on a vox populi bluff. The voice of the
      majority goes. You tharfore lose your bets to Boggs; drinks on Boggs, of
      course. Thar is another matter,' continues Enright, 'a bet we overlooks.
      Takin' care of this Yallerhouse gent will cost a stack or two, an' means
      must be provided. I tharfore makes as an order that yereafter thar's to be
      a rake on tens-up or better, showed, to make a fund to back this play;
      said rake to go ontil Mister Moore reports said Yallerhouse gent as safe
      or ceased to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack takes this Yallerhouse party over to the calaboose an' lays him away
      on some blankets. The calaboose is dry, an' what you-alls might call,
      commodious. It's a slam-up camp; yes indeed! Never has but Steve Stevenson
      in it. Puts Steve in one night when he's dead- drunk. The calaboose is new
      then, an' we-alls is that proud an' anxious to try it an' put it to some
      use, we couldn't resist, so in Steve goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About four hours later Steve comes back up to the Red Light, hotter'n a
      burnt boot. Seems like he comes to, an' is that outraged an' indignant
      about bein' corralled that a-way, he busts the corner outen the calaboose
      an' issues forth a whole lot to find who does it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he comes into the Red Light he revives himse'f with a drink, an'
      then inquires whether it's humorous, or do we mean it? Seein' how speshul
      low Steve takes it, we-alls allows it's a joke; an' Steve, while he
      evident feels some fretted, concloods to let it go at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But on account of the hole through which Steve emerges, an' which he
      makes liberal an' big, the calaboose is a mighty commodious place. So Jack
      beds down the Yallerhouse man all right an' starts in to bringin' him
      through. The rest of us don't crowd 'round none to watch the play, don't hover
      over it that a-way, 'cause we ain't aimin' to acquire nothin' ourse'fs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack has a heap of trouble an' worry. Never sees no smallpox do you?
      Folks locoed most usual,&mdash;clean off up in the air an' pitchin' on
      their ropes. Of course the Yallerhouse gent has all he needs. That rake on
      tens-up them days would have took care of a fam'ly. But he keeps Jack
      herdin' him all the time. Otherwise, not bein' watched, an' crazy that
      a-way, he's liable to come stampedin' over to the Red Light, or some'ers
      else, any time, an' skeer us up some.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He's a world-beater,' says Jack one day, when he comes over for a drink.
      'He's shorely four kings an' an ace. You can't ride him with
      buckin'-straps an' a Spanish bit. It's got so now&mdash;his disease bein'
      at a crisis like&mdash;that I simply has to be with this Yallerhouse party
      day an' night. He'd shorely lay waste this camp if I didn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last the Yallerhouse party an' Jack somehow beats the smallpox, but
      Yallerhouse comes out shy an eye. The smallpox gouges it out one of them
      times when Jack ain't lookin' out his game sharp. It's his pistol eye,
      too; which makes him feel the loss more keen, an' creates general
      sympathy. The Yallerhouse man gets some morose over it, which ain't, after
      all, onnacheral. A gent ain't got so many eyes he can afford to go short
      one on every little game he plays. So he finds fault with Jack a lot, an'
      allows if he has him back in the States he'd sue him for neglect of dooty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which, I shorely likes that!' says Jack to the Yallerhouse party,
      gettin' peevish over his fault-findin'. 'Don't you know it's merely owin'
      to the mercy of hell an' my watchful care, you-all ain't bustin' your
      harp-strings an' raisin' all round discord among the heavenly hosts on
      high right now, instead of bein' safe an' well yere in Wolfville? You
      don't act like a gent who saveys when he makes a winnin'. S'pose you be an
      eye out; you're still lookin' at things terrestrial with the other. You
      talks of gross neglect of dooty! Now let me inform you of somethin': You
      come pesterin' 'round me some more an' I'll bend a gun over your head.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if it ain't my six-shooter eye which's out,' says the Yallerhouse
      party, mighty ugly, 'do you know what I'd do? Well, this yere would be the
      basis of a first-class gun-play. You can gamble thar wouldn't be no
      jim-crow marshal go pirootin' 'round, losin' no eye of mine an' gettin'
      away with it, an' then talk of bendin' guns on me; none whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it all preys on Jack. An' a-seein' of this Yallerhouse gent 'round
      camp a-lookin' at him in a fault-findin' way outen his one eye sorter
      aggravates Jack like it's a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I wouldn't mind it so much,' says Jack to me, confidential, 'if this
      Yallerhouse gent quits a laig or an arm behind, 'cause in which event we
      pieces him out with wood, easy. But about eyes, it's different. An eye out
      is an eye out; an' that settles it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day Jack can't b'ar it no longer, an', resolvin' to end it, he walks
      up to the Yallerhouse party in the Red Light, all brisk an' brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a rough deal on a one-eyed gent,' says Jack, 'an' I shore asks
      pardon an' states regrets in advance. But things has got to a show-down.
      I'm slowly becomin' onfit for public dooty. Now yere's an offer, an' you
      can have either end. You-all can get a hoss an' a hundred dollars of me,
      an' pull your freight; or you can fix yourse'f with a gun an' have a
      mighty stirrin' an' eventful time with me right yere. As an outcome of the
      last, the public will have one of us to plant, an' mebby a vacancy to fill
      in the post of kettle-tender. Which is it, an' what do you say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for a hoss is she?' asked the Yallerhouse party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which she's a pinto,' says Jack; 'as excellent a paint pony as ever is
      roped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does this yere threat you-all makes incloode a saddle an' spurs?' asks
      the Yallerhouse party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It shorely does,' replies Jack. 'Is it a go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' says the Yallerhouse man, after ponderin' it up one way an' down
      the other, 'this idee of settlin' for eyes for a hoss an' a hundred
      dollars is far from bein' usual with me. If I has my eye ag'in, I'd
      shorely stay an' shoot it out, an' admire to be present. But now sech
      thoughts is vanity. So round up your money an' your pony at the Red Light
      in fifteen minutes by the watch, an' as soon as I gets a bottle filled I'm
      ready to go. I shorely should not regret leavin' an' outfit which puts
      folks in jail for bein' sick, an' connives by reckless an' criminal
      neglect of dooty at their bein' blinded for life.'"

      CHAPTER XIII. JACKS UP ON EIGHTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "No; you can hazard your wealth a lot, thar's no sooperstition lurkin'
      'round in me or my environs; none whatever. I attaches no importance to
      what you-all calls omens."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody had undertaken a disquisition on dreams, and attempted to cite
      instances where the future had been indicated in these hazy visions of our
      sleep. This had served to turn the Old Cattleman's train of thought upon
      the weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's signs, of course, to which I'd shorely bow, not to say pay
      absorbin' heed. If some gent with whom I chooses to differ touchin' some
      matter that's a heap relevant at the time, ups an' reaches for his gun
      abrupt, it fills me full of preemonitions that the near future is mighty
      liable to become loaded with lead an' interest for me. Now thar's an omen
      I don't discount. But after all I ain't consentin' to call them
      apprehensions of mine the froot of no sooperstition, neither. I'm merely
      chary; that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Cherokee Hall who is what I onhesitatin'ly describes as
      sooperstitious. Cherokee is afflicted by more signs an' omens in carryin'
      on his business than an almanac. It's a way kyardsharps gets into, I
      reckons; sorter grows outen their trade. Leastwise I never creeps up on
      one yet who ain't bein' guided by all sorts of miracles an' warnin's that
      a-way. An' sometimes it does look like they acquires a p'inter that comes
      to 'em on straight lines. As 'llustratin' this yere last, it returns to me
      some vivid how Cherokee an' Boggs gets to prophesyin' one day, an' how
      they calls off the play between 'em so plumb c'rrect that a-way, it's more
      than amazin'; it's sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a hot August day, this occasion I has in mind, an' while not
      possessin' one of them heat-gauges to say ackerate, I'm allowin' it's
      ridin' hard on sech weather as this. A band of us is at the post-office
      a-wrastlin' our letters, when in trails Cherokee Hall lookin' some moody,
      an' sets himse'f down on a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which you-all no doubt allows you'll take some missives yourse'f this
      mornin',' says Doc Peets, a-noticin' of his gloom, an' aimin' to p'int his
      idees up some other trail. Doc, himse'f, is feelin' some gala. 'Pass over
      them documents for Cherokee Hall, an' don't hold out nothin' onto us.
      We-alls is 'way too peevish to stand any offishul gaieties to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's no one weak-minded 'nough to write to me none,' says Cherokee.
      `Which I remarks this yere phenomenon with pleasure. Mail- bags packs more
      grief than joy, an' I ain't honin' for no hand in the game whatever. It's
      fifteen years since I buys a stamp or gets a letter, an' all thirst
      tharfor is assuaged complete.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fifteen years is shore a long time,' says Enright, sorter to himse'f,
      an' then we-alls hops into our letters ag'in. Finally Cherokee breaks in
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "` I ain't aimin' to invest Wolfville in no sooperstitious fears,' says
      Cherokee, 'an' I merely chronicles as a current event how I was settin'
      into a little poker last night, an' three times straight I picks up "the
      hand the dead man held," jacks up on eights, an' it wins every time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Who lose to it?' asks Dan Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why,' says Cherokee, 'it's every time that old longhorn as comes in from
      Tucson back some two weeks ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That settles it,' says Boggs, mighty decided. 'You can bet your saddle
      an' throw the pony in, Death is fixin' his sights for him right now. It's
      shorely a warnin', an' I'm plumb glad it ain't none of the boys; that's
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see this yere stranger who Cherokee alloods at comes over from Tucson
      a little while before. He has long white ha'r an' beard, an', jedgin' from
      the rings on his horns, he's mebby a-comin' sixty. He seems like he's
      plenty of money, an' we takes it he's all right. His leavin' Tucson shows
      he has sense, so we cashes him in at his figger. Of course we-alls never
      asks his name none, as askin' names an' lookin' at the brands on a pony is
      speshul roode in the West, an' shows your bringin' up; but he allows he's
      called 'Old Bill Gentry ' to the boys, an' he an' Faro Nell's partic'lar
      friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Talkin' to him,' says Nell, ' is like layin' in the shade. He knows
      everythin', too; all about books an' things all over the world. He was
      a-tellin' me, too, as how he had a daughter like me that died 'way back
      some'ers about when I was a yearlin'. He feels a heap bad about it yet,
      an' I gets so sorry for him; so old an' white-ha'red.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' you can gamble,' says Dave Tutt, 'if Nell likes him, he's all
      right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If Nell likes him, that makes him all right,' says Cherokee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls is still talkin' an' readin over our mail in the post- office,
      when all at once we hears Jack Moore outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's this yere literatoor as affronts my eyes, pasted onto the outside
      of Uncle Sam's wickeyup?' says Jack, mighty truculent. We. alls goes out,
      an' thar, shore-'nough, is a notice offerin' fifteen hundred dollars
      reward for some sharp who's been a-standin' up the stage over towards
      Prescott.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whoever tacks this up? I wonder,' says Enright. `It never is yere ten
      minutes ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, jest you-all hover 'round an' watch the glory of its comin' down,'
      says Jack, a-cuttin' of it loose with his bowie, an' tearin' it up. 'I
      yerewith furnishes the information cold, this camp of Wolfville knows its
      business an' don't have to be notified of nothin'. This yere outfit has a
      vig'lance committee all reg'lar, which I'm kettle-tender tharfor, an' when
      it comes nacheral to announce some notice to the public, you-alls will
      perceive me a- pervadin' of the scenery on a hoss an' promulgatin' of said
      notice viver voce. Am I right, Enright?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Right as preachin', Jack,' says Enright. 'You speaks trooth like a
      runnin' brook.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But whoever sticks that notice?&mdash;that's the information I pants
      for,' says Boggs, pickin' up an' readin' of the piece. "'I reckons I posts
      that notice some myse'f,' says a big, squar'-built gent we- alls don't
      know, an' who comes in the other mornin' with Old Monte on the stage. As
      he says this he's sa'nterin' about the suburbs of the crowd, listenin' to
      the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, don't do it no more, partner,' says Jack, mighty grave. 'As a
      commoonity Wolfville's no doubt 'way wrong, but we-alls has our prides an'
      our own pecooliar little notions, that a-way, about what looks good; so,
      after now, don't alter the landscape none 'round yere till you c'lects our
      views.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm offerin' even money, postin' notices don't hurt this yere camp a
      little bit,' says the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Comin' right to cases,' says Enright, 'it don't hurt none, but it grates
      a whole lot. The idee of a mere stranger a-strollin' in an' a-pastin' up
      of notices, like he's standin' a pat hand on what he knows an' we not in
      it, is a heap onpleasant. So don't do it no more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I don't aim to do it no more,' says the squar'-built gent, 'but I
      still clings to my idee that notices ain't no set-back to this camp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The same bein' a mere theery,' says Doc Peets, 'personal to yourse'f, I
      holds it would be onp'lite to discuss it; so let's all wheel onder cover
      for a drink.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this we-alls lines up on the Red Light bar an' nacherally drinks ends
      the talk, as they allers ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Along towards sundown we-alls gets some cooler, an' by second-drink time
      in the evenin' every one is movin' about, an', as it happens, quite a band
      is in the Red Light; some drinkin' an' exchangin' of views, an' some
      buckin' the various games which is goin' wide open all 'round. Cherokee's
      settin' behind his box, an' Faro Nell is up at his shoulder on the lookout
      stool. The game's goin' plenty lively when along comes Old Gentry.
      Cherokee takes a glance at him an' seems worried a little, reflectin', no
      doubt, of them 'hands the dead man held,' but he goes on dealin' without a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where's you-all done been all day?' says Nell to the old man. 'I ain't
      seen you none whatever since yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why, I gets tired an' done up a lot, settin ag'inst Cherokee last
      night,' says the old man, 'an' so I prowls down in my blankets an' sleeps
      some till about an hour ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man buys a stack of blues an' sets 'em on the ten. It's jest then
      in comes the squar'-built gent, who's been postin' of the notice former,
      an' p'ints a six-shooter at Gentry an' says
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Put your hands up! put 'em up quick or I'll drill you! Old as you be, I
      don't take no chances.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'At the first word Nell comes off her stool like a small landslide, while
      Cherokee brings a gun into play on the instant. The old man's up even with
      the proceedin's, too; an' stands thar, his gun in his hand, his eyes
      a-glitterin' an' his white beard a-curlin' like a cat's. He's clean
      strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Let me get a word in, gents,' says Cherokee, plenty ca'm, 'an' don't no
      one set in his stack on. less he's got a hand. I does business yere my
      way, an' I'm due to down the first hold-up who shoots across any layout of
      mine. Don't make no mistake, or the next census'll be shy, shore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What be you-alls aimin' to cel'brate anyhow?' says Jack Moore, gettin'
      the squar'-built gent's gun while Boggs corrals Gentry's. ' Who's
      Wolfville entertainin' yere, I'd like for to know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm a Wells-Fargo detective,' says the squar'-built gent, 'an' this
      yere,' p'intin' to Old Gentry, 'is Jim Yates, the biggest hold- up an'
      stage-robber between hell an' 'Frisco. That old tarrapin'll stop a stage
      like a young-one would a clock, merely to see what's into it. He's the
      party I'm pastin' up the notice for this mornin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He's a liar!' says the old man, a-gettin' uglier every minute. `Give us
      our six-shooters an throw us loose, an' if I don't lance the roof of his
      lyin' mouth with the front sight of my gun, I'll cash in for a hold-up or
      whatever else you-alls says.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you say, Enright?' says Jack. 'Let's give 'em their jewelry an'
      let 'em lope. I've got money as says the Wells-Fargo bill-paster can't
      take this old' Cimmaron a little bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I trails in,' says Boggs, 'with a few chips on the same kyard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' says Enright, 'if this yere party's rustlin' the mails, we- alls
      can't call his hand too quick. Wolfville's a straight camp an' don't back
      no crim'nal plays; none whatever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright tharupon calls a meetin' of the Stranglers, an' we-alls lines out
      for the New York Store to talk it over. Before we done pow-wows two
      minutes up comes Old Monte, with the stage, all dust an' cuss-words, an'
      allows he's been stood up out by the cow springs six hours before, an' is
      behind the mail-bag an' the Adams Company's box on the deal. We-alls looks
      at Old Man Gentry, an' he shorely seems to cripple down. "'Gentry,' says
      Peets, after Old Monte tells his adventures, 'I hears you tell Nell you
      was sleepin' all day. S'pose you takes this yere committee to your budwer
      an' exhibits to us how it looks some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The turn's ag'in me,' says the old man, 'an' I lose. I'll cut it short
      for you-alls. I holds up that stage this afternoon myse'f.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere's straight goods, I takes it,' says Enright, 'an' our dooty is
      plain. Go over to the corral an' get a lariat, Jack.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't let Enright hang the old man, Cherokee,' says Nell, beginnin' to
      weep a whole lot. 'Please don't let 'em hang him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This holdin' a gun on your friends ain't no picnic,' whispers Cherokee
      to Nell, an' flushin' up an' then turnin' pale, 'but your word goes with
      me, Nell.' Then Cherokee thinks a minute. 'Now, this yere is the way we
      does,' he says at last. 'I'll make 'em a long talk. You-all run over to
      the corral an' bring the best hoss you sees saddled. I'll be talkin' when
      you comes back, an' you creep up an' whisper to the old man to make a jump
      for the pony while I covers the deal with my six-shooter. It's playin' it
      low on Enright an' Doc Peets an' the rest, but I'll do it for you, Nell.
      It all comes from them jacks up on eights.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this, Cherokee tells Nell 'good-by,' an' squar's himse'f. He begins
      to talk, an' Nell makes a quiet little break for the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But no hoss is ever needed. Cherokee don't talk a minute when Old Gentry
      comes buckin' offen his chair in a 'pleptic fit. A 'pleptic fit is
      permiscus an' tryin', an' when Old Gentry gets through an' comes to
      himse'f, he's camped jest this side of the dead line. He can only whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come yere,' says he, motionin' to Cherokee. 'Thar's a stack of blues
      where I sets 'em on the ten open, which you ain't turned for none yet:
      Take all I has besides an' put with it. If it lose, it's yours; if it win,
      give it to the little girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is all Old Gentry says, an' he cashes in the very next second on the
      list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright goes through'em, an' thar's over two thousand dollars in his
      war-bags; an', obeyin' them last behests, we-alls goes over to the Red
      Light an' puts it on the ten along of the stack of blues. It's over the
      limit, but Cherokee proceeds with the deal, an' when it comes I'm blessed
      if the ten ain't loser an' Cherokee gets it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But I won't win none ag'in a dead man; says Cherokee. An' he gives it to
      Nell, who ain't sooperstitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Do you-alls b'ar in mind,' says Boggs, as we takes a drink later, 'how I
      foresees this yere racket the minute I hears Cherokee a- tellin' about his
      "Jacks up on eights"&mdash;the "hand the dead man holds?"'"

      CHAPTER XIV. THE RIVAL DANCE-HALLS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was sweet and cool after the rain, and the Old Cattleman and I, moved
      by an admiration for the open air which was mutual, found ourselves
      together on the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in part recompense for his reminiscences of the several days before, I
      regaled my old friend with the history of a bank-failure, the details as
      well as the causes of which were just then forcing themselves upon me in
      the guise of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," I said, as I came to the end of my story, "the fact is, the
      true cause of this bank's downfall was a rivalry&mdash;what one might call
      a business feud&mdash;which grew into being between it and a similar
      institution which had opened as its neighbor. In the competition which
      fell out they fairly cut each other's throat. They both failed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' I takes it," remarked the Old Cattleman in comment, "one of these
      yere trade dooels that a-way goes on vindictive an' remorseless, same as
      if it's a personal fight between cow-folks over cattle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right," I said. "Money is often more cruel than men; and a business
      vendetta is frequently mere murder without the incident of blood. I don't
      suppose the life of your Arizona town would show these trade wars. It
      would take Eastern&mdash;that is, older&mdash;conditions, to provoke and
      carry one on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the old gentleman, with an air of retrospection, "I don't
      recall nothin' of the sort in Wolfville. We're too much in a huddle,
      anyway; thar ain't room for no sech fracas, no how. Now the nearest
      we-alls comes to anythin' of the kind is when the new dance- hall starts
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I reckons," continued the Old Cattle. man, as he began arranging a
      smoke, "which I now reckons this yere is the only catyclism in trade
      Wolfville suffers; the only time it comes to what you-all Eastern sports
      would call a showdown in commerce. Of course thar's the laundry war, but
      that's between females an' don't count. Females&mdash;while it's no sorter
      doubt they's the noblest an' most exhilaratin' work of their Redeemer&mdash;is
      nervous that a-way, an' due any time to let their ha'r down their backs,
      emit a screech, an' claw an' lay for each other for luck. An', as I says,
      if you confines the festivities to them females engaged, an' prevents the
      men standin' in on the play, it's shore to wind up in sobs an'
      forgiveness, an' tharfore it don't go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I says, what I now relates is the only industrial trouble I recalls in
      Wolfville. I allers remembers it, 'cause, bein' as how I knows the party
      who's the aggravatin' cause tharof, it mortifies me the way he jumps into
      camp an' carries on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I sees him first is ages before, when I freights with eight mules
      over the Old Fort Bascome trail from Vegas to the Panhandle. This sharp&mdash;which
      he's a tenderfoot at the time, but plumb wolf by nacher-trails up to me in
      the Early Rose Saloon in Vegas one day, an' allows he'd like to make a
      deal an' go projectin' over into the Panhandle country with me for a trip.
      "Freightin' that a-way three weeks alone on the trail is some harrowin' to
      the sperits of a gent who loves company like me, so I agrees, an' no delay
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I'm yere to mention I regrets later I'm that easy I takes this
      person along. Not that he turns hostile, but he's allers havin'
      adventures, an' things keeps happenin' to him; an' final, I thinks he's
      shorely dead an' gone complete&mdash;the same, as I afterward learns,
      bein' error; an', takin' it up one trail an' down another, that trip
      breaks me offen foolin' with shorthorns complete, an' I don't go near 'em
      for years, more'n if they's stingin' lizards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever does this yere maverick do to me? Well, nothin' much to me
      personal; but he keeps a-breedin' of events which pesters me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're out about four days when them mishaps begins. I camps over one sun
      on the Concha to rest my mules. I'm loaded some heavy with six thousand
      pounds in the lead, an' mebby four thousand pounds in the trail wagon; an'
      I stops a day to give my stock a chance to roll an' breathe an' brace up.
      My off-wheel mule&mdash;a reg'lar shave-tail&mdash; is bad med'cine. Which
      he's not only eager to kick towerists an' others he takes a notion
      ag'inst; but he's likewise what you-alls calls a kleptomaniac, an' is out
      to steal an' sim'lar low-down plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warns this yere tenderfoot&mdash;his name's Smith, but I pulls on him
      when conversin' as 'Colonel'&mdash;I warns this shorthorn not to fuss
      'round my Jerry mule, bein', as I states, a mule whose mood is ornery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't go near him, Colonel,' says I; 'an' partic'lar don't go crowdin'
      'round to get no r'ar views of him. You-all has no idee of the radius of
      that mule; what you might call his sweep. You never will till he's kicked
      you once or twice, an' the information ain't worth no sech price. So I
      don't reckon I'd fool with him, none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' speshul, Colonel,' I goes on, for I shore aims to do my dooty by
      him, 'don't lay nothin' 'round loose where this yere Jerry mule can grab
      it off. I'm the last freighter on the Plains to go slanderin' an'
      detractin' of a pore he'pless mule onless it's straight; but if you-all
      takes to leavin' keepsakes an' mementoes layin' about casooal an' careless
      that a-way, Jerry'll eat 'em; an' the first you saveys your keepsakes is
      within Jerry's interior, an' thar you be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The fact is, stranger, this Jerry mule's a thief,' I says. 'If he's a
      human, Jerry would be lynched. But otherwise he's a sincere, earnest mule;
      an up hill or at a quicksand crossin' Jerry goes into his collar like a
      lion; so I forgives him bein' a thief an' allows it's a peccadillo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, you bet!' says this tenderfoot Colonel, 'this yere Jerry better
      not come no peccadillos on me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If you-all maintains about twenty feet,' I replies, 'between Jerry's
      hind-Hocks an' you; an' if you keeps your bric-a-brac in your war-bags,
      you an' Jerry'll get along like lambs. Now, I warns you, an' that's got to
      do. If Jerry an' you gets tangled up yereafter you-all ain't goin' to
      harbor no revenges ag'in him, nor make no ranikaboo plays to get even.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I states, I'm camped on the Concha, an` the Colonel, who's allers out
      to try experiments an' new deals, puts it up he'll go down to the river
      an' take a swim. Tharupon he lines out for the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jerry's hangin' about camp&mdash;for he's sorter a pet mule&mdash;allowin'
      mebby I submits a ham-rind or some sech delicacy to him to chew on; an' he
      hears the Colonel su'gest he'll swim some. So when the Colonel p'ints for
      the Concha, Jerry sa'nters along after, figgerin', mighty likely, as how
      he'll pass the hour a-watchin' the Colonel swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm busy on flapjacks at the time&mdash;which flapjacks is shore good
      food&mdash;an' I don't observe nothln' of Jerry nor the Colonel neither.
      They's away half an hour when I overhears ejac'lations, though I can't
      make out no words. I don't have to get caught in no landslide to tumble to
      a game, an' I'm aware at once that Jerry an' the Colonel has got their
      destinies mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nacherally, I goes over to the held of strife, aimin' to save Jerry, or
      save the Colonel, whichever has the other down. When I bursts on the
      scene, the Colonel starts for me, splutterin' an' makin' noises an'
      p'intin' at Jerry, who stands thar with an air of innocence. The Colonel's
      upper lip hangs down queer, like an ant- eater's, an' he can't talk. It's
      all mighty amazin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's all this toomult about?' I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The short of the riot is this: The Colonel goes in for a swim, an' he
      lays out his false teeth that a-way on a stone. When he comes for his
      teeth they's shorely gone, an' thar stands Jerry puttin' it on he's
      asleep. Them teeth is filed away in Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the Colonel raves 'round frightful, an' wants to kill Jerry an'
      amputate him, an' scout for the teeth. But I won't have it. I'm goin' to
      need Jerry down further on the quicksand fords of the Canadian; an', as I
      explains, them teeth is a wreck by now, an' no good if he get's 'em ag'in;
      Jerry munchin' of his food powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After a while I rounds up the Colonel an' herds him back to camp. Jerry
      has shore sawed off a sore affliction on that tenderfoot when he takes in
      them teeth; I can see that. His lip hangs like a blacksmith's apron, an'
      he can't talk a little bit; jest makes signs or motions, like he's Injun
      or deef.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mebby two weeks later when Jerry gets another shot at the Colonel.
      It's the evenin' after the night Jerry sneaks into camp, soft-foot as a
      coyote, noses open the grub-box, an' eats five bottles of whiskey; all we
      has. We've pitched camp, an' I've hobbled this Jerry mule an' his mate&mdash;the
      other wheeler&mdash;an' throwed 'em loose, an' is busy hobblin' my
      nigh-swing mule, when trouble begins fomentin' between my tenderfoot an'
      Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is it's done fomented. This Colonel, bein' some heated about
      that whiskey, an' plumb sore on Jerry on account of them teeth, allows to
      himse'f he'll take a trace-chain an' warp Jerry once for luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this yere tenderfoot had been free with me, an' invited me into his
      confidence touchin' his designs, I'd took a lariat an' roped an' throwed
      Jerry for him, an' tied the felon down, an' let the Colonel wallop him an
      hour or so: but the Colonel's full of variety that a- way, or mebby he
      thinks I'll side with Jerry. Anyhow, he selects a trace-chain, an',
      without sayin' a word, dances all cautious towards his prey. Which this is
      relaxation for Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      [drawing of Jerry kicking the Colonel with caption: "That he'pless
      shorthorn stops both heels.]
    </p>
    <p>
      "While that Colonel tenderfoot is a rod away, Jerry turns his tail some
      sudden in his direction, an' the next instant that he'pless shorthorn
      stops both heels some'ers about the second button of his shirt. That
      settles it; the Colonel's an invalid immediate. I shorely has a time with
      him that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day he can't walk, an' he can't ride in the wagon 'cause of the
      jolts. It all touches my heart, an' at last I ups an' make a hammock outen
      a Navajo blanket, which is good an' strong, an' swings the Colonel to the
      reach of the trail wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mostly a good scheme. Where the ground's level the Colonel comes on
      all right; but now an' then, when a wheel slumps into a rut, the Colonel
      can't he'p none but smite the ground where he's the lowest, an' it all
      draws groans an' laments from him a heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One time, when the Colonel's agony makes him groan speshul strong, I sees
      Jerry bat his eyes like he enjoys it; an' then Jerry mentions somethin' to
      his mate over the chain. We're trottin' along the trail at the time, an',
      bein' he's the nigh-wheeler&mdash;which is the saddle- mule of a team&mdash;I'm
      ridin' Jerry's compadre, an' when I notes how Jerry is that joyous about
      it I reaches across an' belts him some abrupt between the y'ears with the
      butt of a shot-filled black- snake. It rather lets the whey outen Jerry's
      glee, an' he don't get so much bliss from that tenderfoot's misfortunes as
      he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It goes along all right ontil I swings down to the crossin' of the
      Canadian. It's about fourth-drink time in the afternoon, an' I'm allowin'
      to ford the Canadian that evenin' an' camp on t'other side. The river is
      high an' rapid from rain some'ers back on its head waters, an' it's wide
      an' ugly. It ain't more'n four foot deep, but the bottom is quicksand, an'
      that false, if I lets my wagons stop ten seconds anywhere between bank an'
      bank, I'm goin' to be shy wagons at the close. I'll be lucky if I win out
      the mules. It's shore a hard, swift crossin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swings down, as I says, to the river's aige with my mind filled up
      about the rush I've got to make. It's go through on the run or bog down.
      First I settles in my saddle, gives the outfit the word, an' then, pourin'
      the whip into the two leaders, I sends the whole eight into the water on
      the jump. The river is runnin' like a scared wolf, an' the little lead
      mules hardly touches bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the trail wagon takes the water, an' the two leaders is plumb in to
      the y'ears, a howl develops to the r'ar. It's my pore tenderfoot in his
      hammock onder the trail wagon. He shrieks as the water gets to him; an' it
      all hits me like a bullet, for I plumb overlooks him, thinkin' of that
      quicksand crossin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's shore too late now; I'm in, an' I can't stop. To make things more
      complex, as the water cuts off the tenderfoot's yell like puffin' out a
      candle, a little old black mule, which is my off- p'inter, loses his feet
      an' goes down. I pours the leather into the team the harder, an' the
      others soars into their collars an' drug my black p'inter with 'em; only
      he's onder water. Of course I allows both the black p'inter an' the
      Colonel's shorely due to drown a whole lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We gets across, the seven other mules an' me; an' the second he's skated
      out on the sand on his side, the drowned mule gets up an' sings as
      triumphant as I ever hears. Swimmin' onder the river don't wear on him a
      bit.
    </p>

      "Then I goes scoutin' for the Colonel, but he's vanished complete.
      Nacherally, I takes him for a dead-an'-gone gent; an' figgers if some eddy
      or counter-current don't get him, or he don't go aground on no sand-bar,
      his fellow-men will fish him out some'ers between me an' New Orleans, an'
      plant him an' hold services over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bein' as I can't be of no use where it's a clean-sweep play like this, I
      dismisses the Colonel from my mind. After hobblin' an' throwin' loose my
      team, I lugs out the grub-box all sorrowful an' goes into camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I should allers have played the Colonel for dead, if it ain't that
      years later he one day comes wanderin' into Wolfville. He ain't tender
      now; he's as hard as moss-agates, an' as worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I renews my acquaintance with him, an' he tells how he gets outen the
      Canadian that day; but beyond that we consoomes a drink or two together, I
      rather passes him up. Thar's a heap about him I don't take to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Colonel lays 'round Wolfville mebby it's a week, peerin' an' spyin'
      about. He says he's lookin' for an openin'. An' I reckons he is, for at
      the end of a week he slaps up a joint outen tent-cloth an' fence-boards,
      an' opens a dance-hall squar' ag'inst Jim Hamilton's which is already
      thar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere alone is likely to brood an' hatch trouble; but, as if takin' a
      straight header into Hamilton's game ain't enough, this Colonel of mine
      don't get no pianer; don't round-up no music of his own; but stands pat
      an' pulls off reels, an' quadrilles, an' green- corn dances to Hamilton's
      music goin' on next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm through the Lincoln County war, an' has been romancin' about the
      frontier for years; but I never tracks up on no sech outrage in my life as
      this disgraceful Colonel openin' a hurdy-gurdy ag'in Hamilton's, an'
      maverickin' his music that a-way, an' dancin' tharunto.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the second night, an' Hamilton concloods he'll see about it some. He
      comes into the Colonel's joint, ca'm an' considerate, an' gives it out
      thar's goin' to be trouble if the Colonel don't close his game or play in
      his own fiddlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if you-all don't close your game or hunt out your own music,' says
      Hamilton, 'I'm mighty likely to get my six-shooter an' close it for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'See yere,' says my Colonel&mdash;which he's shore been learnin' since I
      parts with him on the Canadian&mdash;'the first hold-up who comes foolin'
      'round to break up a baile of mine, I'll shorely make him hard to find.
      What business you got fillin' up my place with your melodies? You rolls
      your tunes in yere like you owns the ranch; an' then you comes curvin'
      over an' talks of a gun-play 'cause, instead of layin' for you for that
      you disturbs my peace with them harmonies, I'm that good-nachered I yields
      the p'int an' dances to 'em. You-all pull your freight,' says the Colonel,
      'or I'll fill you full of lead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This argument of the Colonel's dazzles Hamilton to that degree he don't
      know whether he's got the high hand or not. He thinks a minute, an' then
      p'ints over to the Red Light for Enright an' Doc Peets. As he leaves the
      rival dance-hall, the Colonel, who's callin' off his dances, turns to the
      quadrille, which is pausin pendin' the dispoote, an' shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You bet I knows my business! Right hand to your partner; grand right an'
      left!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Hamilton turns away they's shore makin' things rock an' tremble; an'
      all to the strains of 'The Arkansaw Traveller,' which is bein' evolved
      next door at Hamilton's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which somethin's goin' to pop; says Hamilton, mighty ugly to Enright an'
      the rest of us, as he pours a drink into his neck. 'I allows in the
      interests of peace that I canters over an' sees you- alls first. I ain't
      out to shake up Wolfville, nor give Red Dog a chance to criticise us none
      as a disorderly camp; but I asks you gents, as citizens an' members of the
      vig'lance committee, whether I'm to stand an' let this yere sharp round-up
      my music to hold his revels by, an' put it all over me nightly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't see no difference,' says Dan Boggs, 'between this convict
      a-stealin' of Hamilton's music, than if he goes an' stands up Old Monte
      an' the stage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The same bein' my idee exact,' says Texas Thompson. 'Yere's Hamilton
      caterin' to this camp with a dance-hall. It's a public good thing. If a
      gent's morose, an' his whiskey's slow placin' itse'f, he goes over to
      Hamilton's hurdy-gurdy an' finds relaxation an' relief. Now yere comes
      this stranger&mdash;an' I makes it fifty dollars even he's from
      Massachusetts&mdash;an' what does he do? Never antes nor sticks in a white
      chip, but purloins Hamilton's strains, an' pulls off his dances tharby.
      It's plumb wrong, an' what this party needs is hangin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, I don't know,' says Cherokee Hall, who's in on the talk. 'Hamilton's
      all right, an' a squar' man. All he wants is jestice. Now, while I deems
      the conduct of this stranger low an' ornery; still, comin' down to the
      turn, he's on his trail all right. As this sharp says: Who gives Hamilton
      any license to go fillin' his hurdy- gurdy full of dance-music? S'pose
      this gent would come caperin' over an' set in a stack ag'in Hamilton for
      overloadin' his joint with pianer an' fiddle noises without his consent;
      an' puttin' it up he's out to drag the camp if Hamilton don't cease? The
      only way Hamilton gets 'round that kind of complaint is, he don't own them
      walses an' quadrilles after they fetches loose from his fiddle; that they
      ain't his quadrilles no more, an' he's not responsible after they
      stampedes off into space.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's straight,' says Dave Tutt, 'you-alls can't run no brand on
      melodies. A gent can't own no music after he cuts it loose that a- way.
      The minute it leaves the bosoms of his fiddles, that's where he lets go.
      After that it belongs to any gent to dance by, cry by, set by, or fight
      by, as he deems meet an' pleasant at the time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you-alls say?' says Hamilton to Enright an' Peets. 'Does this
      yere piece of oppression on a leadin' citizen, perpetrated by a rank
      outsider, go? I shore waits for your reply with impatience, for I eetches
      to go back an' shoot up this new hurdy-gurdy from now till sun-up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright takes Doc Peets down by the end of the bar&mdash;an' thar's no
      doubt about it, that Peets is the wisest longhorn west of the Missoury&mdash;an'
      they has a deep consultation. We-alls is waitin'. some interested, to see
      what they says. It's shore a fine p'int this Colonel's makin' to jestify
      an' back his game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Get a move on you, Enright!' at last says Dan Boggs, who is a hasty,
      eager man, who likes action; 'get a move on you, you an' Peets, an' settle
      this. You're queerin' the kyards an' delayin' the play.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, gents,' says Enright at last, comin' back where we-alls is by the
      door, 'Peets an' me sees no need decidin' on them questions about who owns
      a tune after said tune has been played. But thar is a subject, that a-way,
      which requires consideration; an' which most likely solves this dance-hall
      deadlock. In all trade matters in a growin' camp like Wolfville, it's
      better to preserve a equilibrium. It's ag'in public interest to have two
      or three dance-halls, or two or three saloons, all in a bunch that a-way.
      It's better they be spraddled 'round wide apart, which is more convenient.
      So Peets an' me proposes as a roole for this yere camp that two
      hurdy-gurdies be forbid to be carried on within five hundred feet of each
      other. As it looks like nobody objects, we concloods it's adopted.
      Nacherally, the last hurdy-gurdy up has to move, which disposes of this
      yere trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Before I ends what I has to say,' goes on Enright, 'I wants to thank our
      townsman, Mister Hamilton, for consultin' of the Stranglers prior to a
      killin'. It shows he's a law-abidin' gent an' a credit to the camp. An'
      mighty likely he prolongs his stay on earth. If he'd pranced in an'
      skelped this maraudin' stranger, I don't reckon we could avoid swingin'
      him at the end of a lariat without makin' a dangerous preceedent. As it
      is, his rival will be routed an' his life made sereen as yeretofore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As to the execution of this new roole,' concloods Enright, 'we leaves
      that to Jack Moore. He will wait on this party an' explain the play. He
      must up stakes an' move his camp; an' if he calls on another shindig after
      he's warned, we-alls takes our ponies an' our ropes an' yanks his outfit
      up by the roots. A gent of his enterprise, however, will come to a dead
      halt; an' his persecutions of Hamilton will cease.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' you-all calls this yere a free American outfit!' says my Colonel,
      mighty scornful, when Jack Moore notifies him. 'If I don't line out for
      t'other end of camp you-alls is allowin' to rope my joint an' pull it
      down! Well, that lets me out; I quits you. I'd be shorely degraded to put
      in my time with any sech low-flung passel of sports. You-all may go back
      an' tell your folks that as you leaves you hears me give the call to my
      guests, "All promenade to the bar"; an' the dancin' is done. To-morrow I
      departs for Red Dog to begin life anew. Wolfville is too slow a camp for
      any gent with any swiftness to him.'"

      CHAPTER XV. SLIM JIM'S SISTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Which thar's folks in this caravansary I don't like none," remarked the
      Old Cattleman, as I joined him one afternoon on the lawn. His tone was as
      of one half sullen, half hurt, and as he jerked his thumb toward the hotel
      behind us, it was a gesture full of scorn. "Thar's folks thar, takin' 'em
      up an' down, horns, hide, tallow, an' beef, who ain't worth heatin' a
      runnin'-iron to brand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the trouble?" I inquired, as I organized for comfort with my back
      against the elm-tree which shadowed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No trouble at all," replied my old friend sourly, "leastwise nothin'
      poignant. It's that yoothful party in the black surtoot who comes
      pesterin' me a moment ago about the West bein', as he says, a roode an'
      irreligious outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a young preacher," I explained. "Possibly he was moved by an anxiety
      touching your soul's welfare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if he's out to save souls," retorted the old gentleman, "he oughter
      whirl a bigger loop. No, no, he won't do,"he continued, shaking his head
      with an air of mournful yet resentful decision, "this yere gent's too
      narrow; which his head is built too much the shape of a quail-trap. He may
      do to chase jack-rabbits an' sech, but he's a size too small for game like
      me. Save souls, says you! Why, if that onp'lite young person was to meet a
      soul like mine comin' up the trail, he'd shorely omit what to do entire;
      he'd be that stampeded. He'd be some hard to locate, I takes it, after he
      meets up with a soul like mine a whole lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman made this proclamation rather to himself than me, but I
      could detect an air of pride. Then he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere West you emanates from,' says this young preacher-sharp to me
      that a-way, 'this yere West you hails from is roode, an' don't yield none
      to religious inflooences.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' I says back to him, fillin' my pipe at the same time, 'I reckons
      you shorely can c'llect more with a gun than a contreebution box in the
      West, if that's what you-all is aimin' at. But if you figgers we don't
      make our own little religious breaks out in Arizona, stranger, you figgers
      a heap wrong. You oughter have heard Short Creek Dave that time when he
      turns 'vangelist an' prances into the warehouse back of the New York
      Store, an' shows Wolfville she's shore h'ar-hung an' breeze-shaken over
      hell that a-way. Short Creek has the camp all spraddled out before he
      turns his deal-box up an' closes his game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But this yere Short Creek Dave,' he remonstrates to me, 'ain't no
      reg'lar licensed divine. He ain't workin' in conjunctions with no shore
      'nough' sociation, I takes it. This Short Creek person is most likely one
      of them irrelevant exhortin' folks, an' that makes a difference. He don't
      belong to no reg'lar denom'nation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's troo, too,' I says. 'Short Creek ain't workin' with no reg'lar
      religious round-up; he's sorter runnin' a floatin' outfit, criss-crossin'
      the range, prowlin' for mavericks an' strays on his own game. But what of
      that? He's shorely tyin' 'em down an' brandin' 'em right along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, I don't dispoote none the efficacy of your friend's work that
      a-way,' replies the young preacher-sharp, 'but it's irreg'lar; it's plumb
      out of line. Now what you-alls needs in the West is real churches, same as
      we-alls has in the East.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`I ain't none shore of that.' I says, 'an' I'm gettin' a little warm
      onder the collar some with them frills he puts on; 'I ain't none shore.
      The East needn't deem itse'f the only king in the deck; none whatever. The
      West can afford the usual rooles an' let all bets go as they lays, an'
      still get up winner on the deal. I takes it you-alls never notes the West
      sendin' East for he'p?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But that ain't the idee,' he urges. 'Churches that a-way is the right
      thing. They molds a commoonity, churches does. You b'ars witness yourse'f
      that where churches exists the commoonity is the most orderly an' fuller
      of quietood an' peace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not necessarily I don't,' I replies back, for I'm goin' to play my hand
      out if it gets my last chip, 'not necessarily. What I b'ars witness to is
      that where the commoonity is the most orderly that a- way an' fuller of
      quietood an' peace, the churches exists.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I'm shorely some afraid,' he says,&mdash;an' his looks shows he's
      gettin' a horror of me,&mdash;'you belongs to a perverse generation. You-
      all is vain of your own evil-doin'. Look at them murders that reddens the
      West, an' then sit yere an' tell me it don't need no inflooences.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them ain't murders,' I answers; them's killin's. An' as for inflooenccs,
      if you-all don't reckon the presence of a vig'lance committee in a camp
      don't cause a gent to pause an' ponder none before he pulls his gun, you
      dwells in ignorance. However, I'm yere to admit, I don't discern no sech
      sin-encrusted play in a killin' when the parties breaks even at the start,
      an' both gents is workin' to the same end unanimous. It does some folks a
      heap of good to kill 'em a lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's at this p'int the young preacher-sharp pulls his freight, an' I
      observes, by the way he stacks me up with his eyes that a-way, he allows
      mebby I'm locoed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman said no more for a moment, but puffed at his cob pipe in
      thought and silence. I had no notion of involving myself in any combat of
      morals or theology, so I did not invade his mood. At last I suggested in a
      half-tone of inoffensive sympathy that the West was no doubt much
      misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life there," I remarked, "amid new and rough conditions must be full of
      hardship and tragedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      This vague arrow in the air had the effect of sending the old fellow off
      at a tangent. His bent was evidently discursive, and all thoughts of his
      late religious controversy seemed to pass from his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Full of hardship an' tragedy is your remark," he retorted, "an' I joins
      you tharin. Take them disasters that pounces on Slim Jim. What happens in
      the case of this yere Slim Jim tenderfoot," the old fellow continued as a
      damp gleam of sympathy shone in his eye,"is both hardship an' tragedy.
      Which of course thar's a mighty sight of difference. A hardship a gent
      lives through; but it's a tragedy when his light's put out. An' as Slim
      Jim don't live through this none, it's nacherally a tragedy that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I frequent sees bad luck to other folks, as well as comin' to me
      personal, in the years I inhabits the grass country, but this was shorely
      the toughest. It even overplays anythin' Rainbow Sam ever is ag'inst; an'
      the hard luck of Rainbow Sam is a proverb of Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I reckons I was foaled with a copper on me,' says this Rainbow Sam
      to Enright one day. 'In all my born days I never makes a killin'&mdash;never
      gets up winner once. I was foaled a loser, an' I'll keep a-losin' ontil
      this yere malady&mdash;which it's consumption-which has me in charge
      delivers me to the angels an' gets its receipt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mockery what transpires touchin' this Rainbow Sam. Jest as he
      states, the consumption's got him treed an' out on a limb. Doc Peets says,
      himse'f, nothin' can he'p him; an' when Peets quits a little thing like
      consumption an' shoves his chair back, you-alls can gamble a gent's
      health, that a-way, is on a dead kyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recalls how Rainbow Sam dies; which he rides out into eternity easy an'
      painless. We-alls is into a poker-game nne night-that is, five of us&mdash;when
      Doc Peets is called away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'See yere, Rainbow,' says Peets to Rainbow Sam, who's penniless an'
      tharfore lookin' on; 'you never has a morsel of luck in your life. Now,
      yere: You play my hand an' chips awhile. I'm on velvet for three hundred
      an' fifty, an' I'd as soon you'd lose it into the game as any sport I
      knows. An' to rouse your moral nacher I wants to tell you, whatever you
      rakes in you keeps. Now thar's luck at the jump; you can't lose an' you
      may win, so set in yere. Napoleon never has half the show.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peets goes away for an hour about somethin', an' Rainbow Sam takes his
      seat; an', merely to show how one gent outlucks another, while Peets has
      had the luck of dogs it's that profuse an' good, it looks like the best
      Rainbow can get is an even break. For half an hour he wins an' he loses
      about equal; an' he's shore tryin' hard to win, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If I takes in a couple of hundred or so,' says this Rainbow to me, 'I
      allows I'll visit my folks in the States once for luck.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he never visits them folks he adverts to. It's on Boggs's deal, an'
      he's throwin' the kyards 'round when Rainbow's took bad. His consumption
      sorter mutinies onto him all at once. He's got the seat on the left of
      Boggs, too,&mdash;got the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Play my hand,' he says to Hamilton, who's stepped in from the
      dance-hall; 'play my hand, Jim, till I feels a little better. I'll be all
      right in a moment. Barkeep, deal me some whiskey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Rainbow walks over to the bar, an' Hamilton picks up his kyards. I
      notes that Rainbow steps off that time some tottersome; but he's so plumb
      weak that a-way, cats is robust to him; an' so I deems nothin' tharof. I'm
      skinnin' my kyards a bit interested anyhow, bein' in the hole myse'f.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody comes in this deal, an' when the chips is in the center&mdash;
      this yere's before the draw&mdash;Hamilton, speakin' up for Rainbow, says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'These yere's Doc Peets's chips anyhow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which they shorely be,' says Boggs, 'so play 'em merciless, 'cause Peets
      is rich.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's what I asks for,' says Hamilton, 'for I don't aim to make no
      mistakes with pore Rainbow's money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all right,' says Boggs, 'dump 'em in. If you-all lose, it's
      Peets's; if you win, it's Rainbow's.'

      "'Play 'em game an' liberal, Old Man,' says Rainbow over by the bar,&mdash;an'
      it strikes me at the time his tones is weak an' queer; but bein' as I jest
      then notes a third queen in my hand, I don't have no chance to dwell on
      the fact. 'Play 'em game an' free,' says Rainbow ag'in. 'Free as the
      waters of life. Win or lose, she's all the same a hundred year from now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hamilton takes another look an' then raises the ante a hundred dollars.
      This yere is table stakes; this game was; an' the stakes is five hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I plays this,' says Hamilton, as he comes up with the hundred
      raise, 'the same as I would for myse'f, which the same means plenteous an'
      free as a king.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's three of us who stays, one of the same bein' me. I allers recalls
      it easy, 'cause it frost-bites my three queens for over three hundred
      dollars before the excitement dies away. Boggs, who's so vociferous recent
      about Hamilton playin' wide open, stays out; not havin' as good as
      nine-high.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the draw Hamilton allows Rainbow's hand needs one kyard, an' he gets
      it. I takes one also; the same bein' futile, so far as he'pin' my hand
      goes; an' the others takes kyards various.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's only one raise, an' that's when it gets to Hamilton. He sets in a
      little over two hundred dollars, bein' the balance of the stake; an' two
      of us is feeble-minded enough to call. What does he have? Well, it's ample
      for our ondoin' that a-way. It's a straight flush of diamonds; jack at the
      head of the class. It shorely carries off the pot like it's a whirlwind.
      As near as I can measure, Hamilton claws off with about six hundred
      dollars for Rainbow on that one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yere you be, Rainbow!' shouts Boggs. 'Come a-runnin'! It's now you
      visits them relations; you makes a killin' at last.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It turns out some late for Rainbow though. Thar's no reply to Boggs's
      talk, an' when we-alls goes over to him where he's set down by the end of
      the bar thar, with his arm on a monte-table, an' his chin on his shirt,
      Rainbow Sam is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I regrets,' says Doc Peets when he returns, 'that Rainbow don't
      stay long enough to onderstand how luck sets his way at last. It most
      likely comforts him an' makes his goin' out more cheerful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a good sign, though,' says Cherokee Hall, 'that straight flush is.
      Which it shows Rainbow strikes a streak of luck; an' mebby it lasts long
      enough to get him by the gates above all right. That's all I asks when my
      time comes; that I dies when I'm commencin' a run of luck.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! about this Slim Jim tenderfoot an' his tragedy! Do you know I plumb
      overlooks him. I gets trailed off that a-way after pore old Rainbow Sam,
      an' Slim Jim escapes my mem'ry complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the story of this gent, even the little we-alls knows, is a heap
      onusual. No one, onless he's the postmaster, ever does hear his name. He
      sorter ha'nts about Red Dog an' Wolfville indiscriminate for mighty nigh a
      year; an' they calls him 'Slim Jim' with us, an' 'The Tenderfoot' in Red
      Dog; but, as I says, what's his real name never does poke up its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever brings this yere Slim Jim into the cow country is too boggy a
      crossin' for me. Thar ain't a thing he can do or learn to. We-alls has him
      on one round-up, an' it's cl'ar from the jump he ain't meant by Providence
      for the cattle business. The meekest bronco in the bunch bucks him off;
      an' actooally he's that timid he's plumb afraid of ponies an' cattle both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls fixes Slim Jim's saddle with buckin'-straps; an' even fastens a
      roll of blankets across the saddle-horn; but it ain't enough. Nothin' bar
      tyin' Slim Jim into the saddle, like the hoss- back Injuns does to
      papooses, could save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' aside from nacheral awk'ardness an' a light an' fitful seat in a
      saddle, it looks like this Slim Jim has baleful effects on a bronco. To
      show you: One mornin' we ropes up for him a pony which has renown for its
      low sperits. It acts, this yere pony does, like it's suffered some
      disapp'intment which blights it an' breaks its heart; an' no amount of
      tightenin' of the back cinch; not even spurrin' of it in the shoulder an'
      neck like playful people who's out for a circus does, is ever known to
      evolve a buck-jump outen him, he's that sad. Which this is so well known,
      the pony's name is 'Remorse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I says, merely to show the malignant spell this yere Slim Jim casts
      over a bronco, we-alls throws him onto this Remorse pony one mornin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if you can't get along with that cayouse,' remarks Jack Moore at
      the time, 'I reckons it's foreordained you-all has to go afoot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that's how it turns out. No sooner is Slim Jim in the saddle than
      that Remorse pony arches his back like a hoop, sticks his nose between his
      knees, an' gives way to sech a fit of real old worm- fence buckin' as
      lands Slim Jim on his sombrero, an' makes expert ponies simply stand an'
      admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the last round-up Slim Jim attempts; workin' cattle he says
      himse'f is too deep a game for him, an' he never does try no more. So he
      hangs about Wolfville an' Red Dog alternate, turnin' little jim-crow
      tricks for the express company, or he'pin' over to the stage company's
      corrals, an' sorter manages to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now an' then some party who's busy drinkin', an' tharfore hasn't time for
      faro, an' yet is desirous the same be played, stakes Slim Jim ag'inst the
      game; an' it happens at times he makes a small pick- up that a-way. But
      his means of livelihood is shorely what you-alls would call precar'ous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' yet, as I sends my mind back over the trail, I never knows of nothin'
      bad this yere Slim Jim does. You needn't go inferrin' none, from his
      havin' a terror of steers an' broncos that a-way, that he's timid plumb
      through. Thar's reason to deem him game when he's up ag'inst mere man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once, so they tells the story, Curly Bill rounds up this Slim Jim in a
      Red Dog hurdy-gurdy an' concloods to have some entertainment with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Dance, you shorthorn!' says this yere Curly Bill, yankin' out his
      six-shooter an' p'intin' it mighty sudden at Slim Jim's foot; 'shuffle
      somethin' right peart now, or you-all emerges shy a toe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does this Slim Jim dance? Never cavorts a step. At the first move he
      swarms all over this Curly Bill like a wild-cat, makes him drop his gun,
      an' sends him out of the hurdy-gurdy on a canter. That's straight; that's
      the painful fact in the case of Curly Bill, who makes overgay with the
      wrong gent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Later, mebby an hour, so the party says who relates it to me, Curly Bill
      sends back word into the hurdy-gurdy, tellin' the barkeep, if his credit's
      good after sech vicissitoodes, to treat the house. He allows the drinks is
      on him, an' that a committee can find him settin' on the post office steps
      sorter goin' over himse'f for fractures, if it's held necessary for him to
      be present when the drinks is took.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which of course any gent's credit is good at the bar that a-way; an' so a
      small delegation of three ropes up this yere Curly Bill an' brings him
      back to the hurdy-gurdy, where he gets his gun ag'in, an' Slim Jim an' him
      makes up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I renounces all idee of ever seein' you dance some,' says Curly
      Bill, when he an' Jim shakes; 'an' I yereby marks your moccasins plumb off
      my list of targets.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody's pleased at this; an' the barkeep is delighted speshul, as one
      of them reeconciliations that a-way is mighty condoosive to the sale of
      nose-paint. I'm yere to remark, if thar ain't no more reeconciliations on
      earth, an' everybody stands pat on them hatreds an' enmities of his,
      whiskey-drinkin' falls off half.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only su'gest this turn-up with Curly Bill to 'lustrate that it's about
      as I says, an' that while Slim Jim's reluctant an' hesitatin' in the
      presence of wild steers, an' can't adhere to a pony much, this yere
      girlishness don't extend to men none; which last he faces prompt an'
      willin' as a lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's times when I shorely ponders the case of this Slim Jim a mighty
      sight, 'cause he keeps strikin' me as a good gent gone bad, an' as bein'
      the right gent in the wrong place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This pore maverick is plumb Eastern, that's all,' says Enright one day,
      while he's discussin' of this Slim Jim. 'He ain't to blame, but he ain't
      never goin' to do, none whatever, out yere. He can't no more get used to
      Arizona than one of the Disciples, an' he might camp 'round for years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mebby hard onto a year when along comes the beginnin' of the end as
      far as this Slim Jim's concerned, only we-alls don't know it. The
      postmaster says afterward he gets a letter; an' by what's found on the
      remainder it looks like the postmaster's right, an' this letter sets him
      goin' wrong. I allers allows, after he gets this missive, that he sees the
      need of money that a-way an' plenty of it; an' that it's got to come
      quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most likely he's been bluffin' some parties in the East about how rich he
      is an' how lucrative he's doin',&mdash;sech bluffs bein' common in the
      West,&mdash;an' now along comes events an' folks he's fooled, an' his
      bluff is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it arrives, none of us knows of this yere letter the postmaster
      mentions, an' which is later read by all; but it's about that time Slim
      Jim acts queer an' locoed. He's flustered an' stampeded about somethin',
      we-alls notes that; an' Dave Tutt even forgets himse'f as a gent so far as
      to ask Slim Jim what's up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Which you looks oneasy these autumn days,' says Tutt to Slim Jim.
      'What's wrong?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nothin',' says Slim Jim, lookin' a bit woozy, 'nothin' wrong. A friend
      of mine is likely to show up yere; that's all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which he has the air of a fugitive from jestice when he says it,'
      observes Tutt, when he speaks of it after all's over; 'though jedgin' by
      the party who's on his trail that time I don't reckon he's done nothin'
      neither.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's shorely the need of money drives this Slim Jim to turnin'
      route-agent an' go holdin' up the stage, for the evenin' he quits camp he
      says to Cherokee Hall: 'S'pose I asks you-all to lend me money, quite a
      bundle, say, would you do it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I turns faro for my money,' says Cherokee; 'which I merely mentions it
      to show I comes honestly by my roll. As to borrowin' of me, you-all or any
      gent in hard lines can get my money by showin' he needs it worse than I
      do; an' to encourage you I might say I don't need money much. So, go on
      an' tell me the news about yourse'f, an' if it's as bad as the way you
      looks, I reckons I'll have to stake you, even if it takes half my pile.'
      Tharupon Cherokee urges Slim Jim to onfold his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Slim Jim gets shy an' won't talk or tell Cherokee what's pesterin'
      him, or how much money he needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' he says, after thinkin' a little, 'I never begs a stake yet, an' I
      never will. Anyhow I sees another way which is better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Countin' noses afterwards, it's probably this talk with Cherokee is the
      last Slim Jim has before he breaks over into the hills on the hunt for
      money. He goes afoot, too; for he don't own no pony, an' he couldn't, as I
      explains previous, stay on him if he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he fixes himse'f with a Winchester which he gets from the
      stage-company people themse'fs on a talk he makes about takin' some
      reecreation with the coyotes, an' p'ints straight over into Rawhide
      Canyon,&mdash;mebby it's six miles from camp. When the stage gets along an
      hour later, this Slim Jim's made himse'f a mask with a handkerchief, an'
      is a full-fledged hold-up which any express company could be proud to
      down. Old Monte relates what happens in the canyon, 'cause from where he's
      stuck up on the box he gets a better view.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yere's how this happens,' says Old Monte, while renooin' his yooth with
      Red Light licker after he's got in. 'It's a little hazy in the canyon,
      comin' evenin' that a-way, an' my eyes is watery with the shootin' goin'
      on, an' I tharfore don't say I notes things none minoote; but as near as I
      can, you gets the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Thar's only one passenger, an' she's a woman. Which for that matter
      she's a beautiful girl, with eyes like a buck antelope's; but bein' she's
      layin' over to the stage station defunct right now, along with this yere
      Slim Jim, I don't dwell none on how she looks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When I pulls out from Tucson I has this yere young female inside; an'
      the company puts two Wells-Fargo gyards on top of the coach, the same
      bein' the first time in months. These Wells-Fargo parties ain't along for
      hold-ups, but jest 'cause they has business over yere, an' so comes by
      stage same as other gents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`It all goes smooth ontil I'm rattlin' along in Rawhide Canyon not
      half-a-dozen miles from where we-alls is now drinkin' all free an'
      amiable, like life's nothin' but sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The first p'inter I has that I'm up ag'inst it, bang! goes a Winchester,
      an' throws my off leader dead ag'inst the trail. Thar's no goin' 'round
      the dead hoss, an' bar the nacheral rarin' an' pitchin' of the other five
      on beholdin' of the ontimely end of their companion that a-way, the whole
      business comes to a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Hold up your hands!" says a voice up the rocks on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My hands is already up, for I'm an old stage-driver, gents, an' you-alls
      can gamble I knows my trade. I'm hired to drive. It ain't no part of my
      game to fight hold-ups an' stand off route-agents that a-way, an' get shot
      dead for it by their pards the next trip; so, as I says, the moment that
      Winchester goes off, I clamps my fingers back of my head an' sets thar. Of
      course I talks back at this hold- up a heap profane, for I don't aim to
      have the name of allowin' any gent to rustle my stage an' me not cuss him
      out. "'But these yere Wells-Fargo sharps, they never holds up their hands.
      That's nacheral enough, for them gents is hired to fight, an' this
      partic'lar trip thar's full six thousand dollars to go to war over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the first shot the Wells-Fargo gents&mdash;they was game as goats
      both of 'em&mdash;slides offen the coach an' takes to shootin'. The guns
      is makin' a high old rattle of it, an' I'm hopin' the hold-up won't get to
      over-shootin' an' drill me, when the first casooalty occurs. One of the
      Wells-Fargo sports gets a bullet plumb through his frame, an' is dead an'
      out in the crack of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It looks like the hold-up sees him tumble, for it's then he cuts loose a
      whoop, jumps down onto the trail an' charges. He comes a- shootin', too,
      an' the way the lead an' fire fetches forth from that Winchester he's
      managin' shore reminds me of them Roman candles last July.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'All this yere don't take ten seconds. An' it don't last ten seconds
      more. As my hold-up comes chargin' an' shootin' towards the stage, I
      overhears a scream inside, an' the next moment that young female passenger
      opens the door an' comes scamperin' out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If she tries she couldn't have selected no worse epock. She hits the
      ground, an' the second she does&mdash;for I'm lookin' over at her at the
      time&mdash;she stops one of that hold-up's bullets an' goes down with a
      great cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's on me, gents, at this p'int to take all resks an' go down an'
      look-out the play for the girl. But I never gets a chance, an' it's as
      well I don't; for towards the last the shootin' of the remainin'
      Wells-Fargo person is reckless an' inordinate. It's plumb reedundant; that
      shootin' is. But as I remarks, I never has no occasion to go to the girl;
      for as I feels the impulse I hears the hold-up shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"God! it's Mary! It's my sister!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's a letter on him we finds later, which shows this statement about
      my passenger bein' his sister is troo; an' that she's p'intin' out when
      downed, now they's orphans&mdash;which the letter states their father's
      jest cashed in&mdash;to come an' keep house for him. As the hold-up makes
      this yere exclamation about the girl bein' his relative that a-way, his
      Winchester goes a-rattlin' onto the trail an' he gathers her in his arms.
      However, he don't last longer than a drink of whiskey now. He don't no
      more'n lift her up, before even he kisses her, the remainin' Wells-Fargo
      gent downs him, an' the riot's over complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Three killed an' none wounded is how results stacks up; an' after me an'
      the live Wells-Fargo gent cl'ars the dead leader outen the trail, we-alls
      lays out the remainders inside all peaceful, an' comes a-curvin' on to
      Wolfville. It's then, as we puts 'em in the coach, I sees that my
      hold-up's that onfortunate felon, Slim Jim. Which I was shorely
      astonished. I says to the Wells-Fargo gent, as we looks at Slim Jim:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Pard, the drinks is due from me on this. If I has a week to guess in,
      I'd never said 'Slim Jim.'"

      CHAPTER XVI. JAYBIRD BOB'S JOKE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Whatever makes this yere jaybird Bob believe he's a humorist," said the
      Old Cattleman one afternoon as we slowly returned from a walk, "whatever
      it is misleads him to so deem himself is shorely too many for me. Doc
      Peets tells him himse'f one day he's plumb wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You-all's nacherally a somber, morose party,' says Doc Peets this time,
      'an' nothin' jocose or jocund about you. Your disp'sition, Jaybird, don't
      no more run to jokes than a prairie-dog's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I would admire to know why not?' says Jaybird Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well,' goes on Doc Peets, 'you thinks too slow&mdash;too much like a cow
      in a swamp. Your mind moves sluggish that a-way, an' sorter sinks to the
      hocks each step. If you was born to be funny your intellects would be
      limber an' frivolous.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bein' all this is personal to me,' says Jaybird Bob, 'I takes leave to
      regard you as wrong. My jokes is good, high-grade jokes; an' when you-all
      talks of me bein' morose, it's a mere case of bluff.' An' so Jaybird goes
      on a-holdin of himse'f funny ontil we- alls has him to bury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Jaybird ain't his shore-'nough name; it's jest a handle to his
      'dentity, so we-alls picks it up handy and easy. Jaybird's real name is
      Graingerford,&mdash;Poindexter Graingerford. But the same is cumbersom an'
      onwieldy a whole lot; so when he first trails into Wolfville we- alls
      considers among ourse'fs an' settles it's a short cut to call him 'Jaybird
      Bob,' that a-way. An' we does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's on the spring round-up this yere Jaybird first develops that he
      regards himse'f witty. It's in the morning as we-alls has saddled up an'
      lines out to comb the range roundabout for cattle. Thar's a tenderfoot
      along whose name is Todd, an', as he's canterin' off, Jaybird comes
      a-curvin' up on his bronco an' reaches over an' tails this shorthorn's
      pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's tailin' a pony? It's ridin' up from the r'ar an' takin' a
      half-hitch on your saddle. horn with the tail of another gent's pony, an'
      then spurrin' by an' swappin' ends with the whole outfit,- -gent, hoss,
      an' all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's really too toomultuous for a joke, an' mebby breaks the pony's neck,
      mebby the rider's. But whether he saves his neck or no, the party whose
      pony is thus tailed allers emergers tharfrom deshevelled an' wrought-up,
      an' hotter than a wolf. So no one plays this yere joke much; not till he's
      ready to get shot at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I says, this Jaybird watches Todd as he rides off. Bein' new on the
      range that a-way, Todd don't ride easy. A cow saddle ain't built like
      these yere Eastern hulls, nohow. The stirrup is set two inches further
      back for one thing, an' it's compiled a heap different other ways. Bein'
      onused to cow saddles, an' for that matter cow ponies, this Todd lops over
      for'ard an' beats with his elbows like he's a curlew or somethin' flyin',
      an' I reckons it's sech proceedin's makes Jaybird allow he's goin' to be
      funny an' tail Todd's pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I explains, he capers along after Todd an' reaches over an' gets a
      handful of the pony's tail; an' then, wroppin' it 'round his saddle-horn,
      he goes by on the jump an' spreads Todd an' his bronco permiscus about the
      scene. This yere Todd goes along the grass on all fours like a
      jack-rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which Todd, I reckons, is the hostilest gent in south-east Arizona.
      Before ever he offers to get up, he lugs out his six-shooter an' makes
      some mighty sincere gestures that a-way to shoot up Jaybird. But he's slow
      with his weepon, bein' spraddled out on the grass, an' it gives Dave Tutt
      an' Enright a chance to jump in between an' stop the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls picks Todd up, an' rounds up his pony,&mdash;which scrambles to
      its feet an' is now cavortin' about like its mind is overturned,&mdash;
      an' explains to him this yere is a joke. But he's surly an' relentless
      about it; an' it don't take no hawk to see he don't forgive Jaybird a
      little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tailin' a gent's pony,' says Todd, 'is no doubt thrillin' amoosement for
      folks lookin' on, but thar's nothin' of a redeemin' nature in it from the
      standp'int of the party whose pony's upheaved that a-way. Not to be
      misonderstood at this yere crisis,' goes on this Todd, 'I wants to
      announce that from now for'ard life will have but one purpose with me,
      which'll be to down the next gent whoever tails a pony of mine. The
      present incident goes as a witticism; but you can gamble the next won't be
      so regarded.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sorter ends the talk, an' all of us but the cook an' the hoss-
      hustlers bein' in the saddle by now, we disperses ourse'fs through the
      scenery to work the cattle an' proceed with the round-up we-alls is on. We
      notes, though, that tailin' Todd's pony don't go ag'in with safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's when we-alls rides away that Doc Peets&mdash;who's out with the
      round-up, though he ain't got no cattle-brand himse'f&mdash;tells Jaybird
      he's not a humorist, like I already repeats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, as I su'gests, this Jaybird Bob can't believe it none. He's mighty
      shore about his jokes bein' excellent good jokes; an' while it's plain
      Todd ain't got no confidence in him an' distrusts him complete since he
      tips over his bronco that mornin', it looks like Jaybird can't let him
      alone. An' them misdeeds of Jaybird's keeps goin' on, ontil by the merest
      mistake&mdash;for it's shore an accident if ever one happens in the cow
      country&mdash;this yere tenderfoot shoots up Jaybird an' kills him for
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks to us like it's a speshul Providence to warn folks not to go
      projectin' about, engaged in what you might call physical jests none.
      Still, this yere removal of Jaybird don't take place till mighty near the
      close of the round-up; an' intervenin', he's pirootin' 'round, stockin'
      the kyards an' settin' up hands on the pore shorthorn continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of Jaybird's jokes&mdash;'one of his best,' Jaybird calls it&mdash;
      results in stampedin' the herd of cattle we-alls is bringin' along at the
      time&mdash;bein' all cows an' their calves&mdash;to a brandin'-pen. Which
      thar's two thousand, big an' little, in the bunch; an' Jaybird's humor
      puts 'em to flight like so many blackbirds; an' it takes two days hard
      ridin' for the whole outfit to bring 'em together ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among other weaknesses this Todd imports from the States is, he's afraid
      of snakes. Rattlesnakes is his abhorrence, an' if each is a disembodied
      sperit he can't want 'em further off. He's allers alarmed that mebby,
      somehow, a rattlesnake will come pokin' in onder his blankets nights, an'
      camp with him while he's asleep. An' this yere wretched Jaybird fosters
      them delusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'About them serpents,' I overhears Jaybird say to him one evenin' while
      we-alls is settin' 'round;&mdash;all but Moore an' Tutt, who's ridin'
      herd; ''bout them serpents; a gent can't be too partic'lar. It looks like
      they has but one hope, which it's to crawl into a gent's blankets an'
      sleep some with him. Which, if he moves or turns over, they simply emits a
      buzz an' grabs him I knows of forty folks who's bit that a-way by snakes,
      an' nary a one lives to explain the game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Be rattlesnakes thick in Arizona?' I hears Todd say to this Jaybird.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Be they thick?' answers Jaybird. 'Well, I shore wishes I had whiskey for
      all the rattlesnakes thar is yereabouts. I don't want to go overstatin'
      the census to a gent who is out playin' for information, an' who's
      learnin' fast, but I s'pose now thar ain't none less than a billion snakes
      in southeast Arizona alone. If I could saw off the little passel of cattle
      I has on this range, you can gamble I'd pull my freight to-morrow. It's
      all right for sech old Cimmarons as Enright, an' sech parties as that
      sawbones Peets, to go bluffin' about thar' bein' no rattlesnakes to speak
      of, an' that they couldn't p'ison you to death no how; but you bet I ain't
      seen forty of my nearest friends cash in of snake-bites, an' not learn
      nothin'. An' almost every time it's a rattlesnake as comes slidin' into
      bed with 'em while they's locked in dreams, an' who gets hot an' goes to
      chewin' of 'em, because they wants to turn out before the snake does.
      Rattlesnakes that a-way wants to sleep till it's fourth-drink time an' the
      sun's 'way up yonder. An' when a gent goes to rollin' out of his blankets
      say at sun-up, it makes 'em monstrous angry to be disturbed; an' the first
      he knows of where they be an' how they looks on early risin', their
      teeth's in him up to the gyard, an' before night thar's one less gent to
      cook for, an' an extra saddle rides along in the grub-wagon with the
      blankets when they next moves camp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course all this is a heap impressive to Todd; an' while Enright an'
      Peets both tells him Jaybird's havin' fun with him, you can see he's
      mortal afraid every night when he spreads his blankets, an' he makes a
      cirele about where he sleeps at with a horse-ha'r lariat he's got from a
      Mexican, an' who tells him it'll tickle the snakes' necks when they goes
      to crawl across it, an' make 'em keep away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The way this yere Jaybird manages to stampede the bunch that time is this
      a-way. Jaybird comes ridin' in from the cattle about three hours before
      sun-up, to turn out Tutt, who is due to take his place on herd. Jaybird's
      got a rawhide rope that he's drugged about in the grass, which makes it
      damp an' cold. As Jaybird rides up to camp he sees this Todd rolled in his
      blankets, snorin' to beat four of a kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nacherally Jaybird's out to be joyous in a second. He rides up close to
      this he'pless shorthorn as he lays asleep, an' tosses a loop of his wet
      rawhide across his countenance where it's turned up in the moonlight. As
      it settles down cold an' startlin' on Todd's skin, Jaybird yells:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snake, Todd! Thar's a rattlesnake on you bigger'n a dog.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jaybird says later as how this Todd behaves tremendous. He b'iles up into
      the atmosphere with a howl like a wolf; an', grabbin' a blanket in each
      hand, he starts out over the plains in a state of frenzy. Which the worst
      is he charges headlong toward the herd; an' what with them shrieks he
      volunteers, an' the blankets flappin' an' wavin', thar ain't a cow in the
      bunch who stays in her right mind a moment. Which she springs to her feet,
      an takin' her offspring along, goes surgin' off into the hills for good.
      You couldn't head or stop 'em then. It's the completest case of stampede I
      ever turns out to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; this yere Todd never gathers the rights of the eepisode. He's that
      peevish an' voylent by nacher no one tells him it's Jaybird; an' onless,
      in the light of knowin' more, he has since figgered out the trooth, he
      allows to this day a rattlesnake as big as a roll of blankets tries to
      recline on his face that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To keep peace in camp an' not let him go to pawin' 'round for real
      trouble with the festive Jaybird, Enright stands in to cap the game
      himse'f; an' puts it up in confab with this Todd the next day as how he
      sees the rattlesnake, an' that it's mighty near bein' a whopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's shore,' says Enright, when he an' Todd is conversin' tharon, 'the
      most giant serpent I ever sees without the aid of licker. An' when he goes
      streakin' off into the gloom, bein' amazed an' rattled by your cries, he
      leaves, so far as I'm concerned, a trail of relief behind. You-all can
      gamble, I wasn't interruptin' of no sech snake, nor makin' of no pretexts
      for his detainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for was his rattles like?' says Todd; an' he gets pale at the mere
      sound of Enright's talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As to them rattles,' says Enright, like he's mighty thoughtful tryin' to
      recall 'em to mind, 'as to this reptile's rattles, it's that dark that
      while I sees 'em I couldn't but jest. So far as I notes anythin' they
      looks like a belt full of car-tridges, sorter corrugated an' noomerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now this yere which I relates, while no doubt burnin' experiences to
      Todd, is after all harmless enough. An' to people not careful about the
      basis of their glee it might do some to laugh at. But it all closes up on
      a play with nothin' gay nor merry in it; leastwise not for Jaybird Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere finish joke of jaybird's transpires one evenin' as the cook's
      startin' in to rustle some chuck. The grub-wagon's been stopped in the
      mouth of Peeled Pine Canyon. Every gent's in camp but this yere tenderfoot
      Todd. Enright, who's actin' as round-up boss for the outfit&mdash;for
      everybody's cattle's bein' worked together that a-way, like we allers does&mdash;has
      sent Todd peerin' 'round for cattle, 'way off up the valley into which the
      Peeled Pine Canyon opens. This yere shorthorn's due to be back any time
      now, 'cause it's only a question of how far up the valley does he go. He
      don't run no show to be lost, for nothin' less aerial than goats could
      climb out of the canyon he's in, an' tharfore he's bound to find camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, knowin' every gent's station in the day's ridin', we- alls is
      plenty aware that this tenderfoot Todd is some'ers above us in the valley.
      None of the rest of us is turnin' our minds to him probably, except
      Jaybird Bob. It all of a bump like a buckin' pony strikes Jaybird that
      he's missin' a onusual chance to be buoyant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What for a play would it be,' says Jaybird, rousin' up from where he
      lays watchin' of the cook slice salt hoss for the fryin'-pan, 'what for a
      game would it be, I says, for a passel of us to lay out up the draw, an'
      bush-whack this yere ontaught person Todd as he comes ridin' down to camp?
      We-alls could hop out at him, a-whoopin' an' shoutin', an' bein' wropped
      up in blankets, he allows it's shore Injuns an' goes plumb locoed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`You-all will keep harrowin' away at this Todd party, Jaybird,' says
      Enright, 'ontil you arises from the game loser. Now I don't reckon none
      I'd play Apache if I'm you. Thar's too much effort in bein' an Apache that
      a-way. I'd lay yere an' think up some joke which don't demand so much
      industry, an' ain't calc'lated to scare an innocent gent to death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Jaybird won't listen. He falls into admiration of his scheme; an' at
      last Tutt an' Jack Moore allows they'll go along an' play they's
      aborigines with Jaybird an' note how the tenderfoot stands the racket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As long as this yere Jaybird's bound to make the play,' says Jack Moore
      to Enright, talkin' one side, 'it's a heap better to have the conserv'tive
      element represented in the deal. So I puts it up, it's a good sage move
      for me an' Tutts to stand in. We-alls will come handy to pull Jaybird an'
      this shorthorn apart if they gets their horns locked in the course of them
      gaities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright takes the same view; so Jaybird an' Moore an' Tutt wanders off up
      the canyon a mile, an' lays in wait surreptitious to head off Todd. Jack
      tells me the story when him an' Tutt comes ridin' back with the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This is how we does,' says Jack. 'Me an' Tutt an' deceased&mdash;which
      last is Jaybird all right enough&mdash;is ensconced behind a p'int of
      rocks. Jaybird's got his blanket wropped, 'round him so he looks like a
      savage. It ain't long when we-alls hears the tenderfoot comin' down the
      canyon; it's likely he's half-mile away. He's runnin' onto us at a
      road-gait; an' when he's about two hundred yards off Jaybird turns out a
      yell to make you shiver, shakes a load or two outen his gun, goes surgin'
      out from 'round the p'int of rocks, an' charges straight at this
      onthinkin' tenderfoot. It is due to trooth to say, me an' Tutt follows
      this Jaybird's suit, only not so voylent as to whoops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does it scare up the tenderfoot? Well, it shorely alarms him a heap. He
      takes Jaybird for an Injun an' makes no question; which the same is nowise
      strange; I'd took him for a savage myse'f, only, bein' in the deal that
      a-way I knows it's Jaybird. So, as I remarks, it horrifies the tenderfoot
      on end, an' at the first sight of Jaybird he whirls his pony an' lights
      out up that valley like antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nacherally we-alls follows; Jaybird leadin', a-whoopin', an' a-
      shootin', an' throwin' no end of sperit into it. It's a success, this
      piece of wit is, up to this juncture, an' Jaybird puts a heap of zest into
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The weak spot in all this yere humor grows out of the idees this
      tenderfoot's been gainin', an' the improvements he's been makin', while
      stragglin' about in our s'ciety. I onhesitatin'ly states that if this yere
      joke is pulled off by Jaybird when Todd first enters our midst, it might
      have been the vict'ry of his life. But Jaybird defers it too long. This
      tenderfoot has acquired a few Western ways; enough to spoil the fun an'
      send pore Jaybird a-curvin' to his home on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This is what that shorthorn does which teaches me he's learnin'. While
      he's humpin' off up the canyon, an' me an' Jaybird an' Tutt is stampedin'
      along in pursoot, the fugitive throws loose his six- shooter, an' without
      even turnin' his head or lookin' back at us, he onhooks the entire bundle
      of lead our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the worst feature of it is, this backhanded, blind shootin' is a
      winner. The very first shot smites Jaybird plumb through the hat, an' he
      goes off his pony without even mentionin' about it to either Tutt or me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`That's all thar is to the report. Dave an' me pulls up our broncos,
      abandons the joke, lays Jaybird across his saddle like a sack of corn, an'
      returns to state the case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever did you-alls do with this frightened stranger?' asks Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which we never does nothin',' says Jack. 'The last I beholds, he's
      flyin' up the valley, hittin' nothin' but the high places. An' assoomin'
      his project is to get away, he's succeedin' admirable. As he vanishes, I
      should jedge from his motions he's reloadin' his gun; an' from the luck he
      has with Jaybird, Tutt an' me is led to believe thar's no real object in
      followin' him no further. I don't press my s'ciety on no gent; shorely not
      on some locoed tenderfoot that a-way who's pulled his gun an' is done
      blazin' away erratic, without purpose or aim.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't you an' Tutt know where he is at?' demands Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which we shorely don't,' says Jack. 'If his hoss holds, an' he don't
      swerve none from the direction he's p'inting out in when he fades from
      view, he's goin' to be over in the San Simon country by to-morrow mornin'
      when we eats our grub; an' that's half way to the Borax desert. If you
      yearns for my impressions,' concloods Jack, 'drawn from a-seein' of him
      depart, I'm free to say I don't reckon you-alls is goin' to meet this yere
      tenderfoot none soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that's about the size of it. Jack calls the turn. Jaybird's last joke
      alarms this tenderfoot Todd plumb outen Arizona, an' thar ain't none of us
      ever sees ha'r, horn, nor hoof mark of him no more. An' he takes with him,
      this Todd does, the boss pony in our bunch."

      CHAPTER XVII. BOGGS'S EXPERIENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "No; thar's nothin' prolix about Boggs. Which on the contrary, his nacher
      is shorely arduous that a-way. If it's a meetin' of the committee, for
      instance, with intent then an' thar to dwell a whole lot on the doin's of
      some malefactor, Boggs allers gets to a mental show-down ahead of the
      other gents involved. Either he's out to throw this party loose, or
      stretch his neck, or run him outen camp, or whatever's deemed exact
      jestice, long before sech slow-an'-shore people as Old Man Enright even
      looks at their hands. The trooth is, Boggs ain't so strong on jedgement;
      his long suit is instinct. An' moreover I knows from his drawin' four
      kyards so much in poker, Boggs is plumb emotional."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in his discourse the Old Cattle man paused and put in
      several profound minutes in apparent contemplation of Boggs. Then he went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it; Boggs is emotional; an' I shorely reckons which he'd even been
      a heap religious, only thar's no churches much on Boggs's range. Boggs
      tells me himse'f he comes mighty near bein' caught in some speritual
      round-up one time, an' I allers allows, after hearin' Boggs relate the
      tale, that if he'd only been submerged in what you- alls calls benigner
      inflooences that a-way, he'd most likely made the fold all right an' got
      garnered in with the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just after Short Creek Dave gets to be one of them 'vangelists. Dave
      has been exhortin' of Wolfville to leave off its ways, over in the
      warehouse of the New York Store, an' that same evenin' Boggs, bein' some
      moved, confides in me how once he mebby half-way makes up his mind he'll
      be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Leastwise,' says Boggs, when he takes me into his past that a-way, 'I
      allows I'll be religious in the spring after the round-up is over. But I
      don't; so you can't, after all, call it a religious exper'ence none;
      nothin' more'n a eepisode.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's winter when I makes them grace-of-heaven determinations,' goes on
      this Boggs, 'an' the spring round-up is months away. But I allers puts it
      up I'd shorely filled my hand an' got plumb into the play, only it's a bad
      winter; an' in the spring the cattle, weak an' starved, is gettin' down
      an' chillin' to death about the water- holes; an' as results tharof I'm
      ridin' the hills, a-cussin' an' a- swearin'; an' all 'round it's that
      rough, an' I'm that profane an' voylent, I reckons towards April probably
      my soul's buried onder ten foot of cuss-words, an' that j'inin' the church
      in my case is mighty likely to be a bluff. An' so I passes it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You sees,' says Boggs, 'thar's no good tryin' to hold out kyards on your
      Redeemer. If your heart ain't right it's no use to set into the game. No
      cold deck goes. He sees plumb through every kyard you holds, an' nothin'
      but a straight deal does with Him. Nacherally, then, I thinks&mdash;bein'
      as how you can't bluff your way into heaven, an' recallin' the bad
      language I uses workin' them cattle&mdash;I won't even try. An' that's
      why, when resolvin' one winter to get religion mebby next June, I persists
      in my sinful life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's over to Taos I acquires this religious idee. I'm come new to the
      camp from some'ers down 'round Seven Rivers in the Pecos country, an' I
      don't know a gent. Which I'm by nacher gregar'ous; so not knowin' folks
      that a-way weighs on me; an' the first night I'm thar, I hastens to remedy
      this yere evil. I'm the possessor of wealth to a limit,&mdash;for I shore
      despises bein' broke complete, an' generally keeps as good as a blue stack
      in my war-bags,&mdash;an' I goes projectin' 'round from dance-hall to
      baile, an' deciminates my dinero an' draws to me nose-paint an' friends.
      As thar ain't but three gin-mills, incloosive of the hurdy-gurdy, I'm
      goin' curvin' in them grand rounds which I institoots, on a sort of
      triangle.

    <p>
      "'Which it can't be said I don't make runnin' of it, however; I don't
      reckon now it's mor'n an hour before I knows all Taos, bar Mexicans an'
      what some folks calls "the better elements." It also follows, like its
      lariat does a loose pony, that I'm some organized by whiskey, not to say
      confused.

    <p>
      "'It's because I'm confused I'm misled into this yere pra'r-meetin.' Not
      that them exercises is due to dim my eternal game none, now nor yereafter;
      but as I ain't liable to adorn the play nor take proper part tharin, I'd
      shorely passed out an' kept on to the hurdy-gurdy if I'd knowed. As it
      stands, I blunders into them orisons inadvertent; but, havin' picked up
      the hand, I nacherally continues an' plays it.

    <p>
      "'It's this a-way about them religious exercises: I'm emerged from the Tub
      of Blood, an' am p'intin' out for the dance-hall, when I strikes a
      wickeyup all lighted, an' singin' on the inside. I takes it for a joint I
      ain't seen none as yet, an' tharupon heads up an' enters. From the noise,
      I allows mebby it's Mexican; which Greasers usual puts up a heap of
      singin' an' scufflin' an' talkin' in everythin' from monte to a
      bull-fight.

      the sight of me, I'm too bashful to break out ag'in, but sorter aiges into

      bank-roll over in Howard's store. It turns out, too, that every time I
      acquires silver in change, I commits it to my left boot, which is high an'
      ample to hold said specie. Why I puts this yere silver money in my
      boot-laig is shore too many for me. But I feels mighty cunnin' over it at
      the time, an' regards it as a 'way-up play.

      spillin' it out in the Tub of Blood is bound to mortify me, an' the

      lays by my bayonet-bush I never knows. He don't disclose nothin' on that

      "'The statistics of the barkeep of the Tub of Blood next day, goes to the
      effect that I'm shorely out thar four hours; an' when Spanish Bill
      discovers me I'm mighty near froze. Taos nights in November has a heap of
      things in common with them Artic regions we hears of, where them fur-lined
      sports goes in pursoot of that North Pole. Bein' froze, an' mebby from an
      over-dab of nose-paint, I never saveys about this yere Spanish Bill
      meetin' up with me that a-way ontil later. But by what the barkeep says,

      you-all is up. Yere's what you do: Thar's five whiskey-checks on the Tub
      of Blood, which will he'p you to an appetite. Followin' of a s'fficient
      quantity of fire-water, you will return to the Jackson House an' eat. I
      pays for it. I won't be outen my blankets by then; but they knows that

      this Bill must have rustled my raiments when he finds me that time when
      I'm presided over by coyotes while I sleeps. When he says it, however, I
      merely remarks that while I'm grateful to him as mockin'-birds, money
      after all ain't no object with me; an', pullin' off my nigh moccasin, I
      pours some two pounds of specie onto the blankets.

      "'"An' I'm feelin' the galiest to hear it," says this Spanish Bill; though
      as I su'gests he acts pained an' amazed, like a gent who's over-looked a
      bet.

    <p>
      "'Well, that's all thar is to that part. That's where Spanish Bill
      launches that bread of his'n; an' the way it later turns out it sorter
      b'ars down on me, an' keeps me rememberin' what that skyscout says at the
      pra'r-meetin' about the action a gent gets by playin' a good deed to win.

    <p>
      "'It's the middle of January, mebby two months later, when I'm over on the
      Upper Caliente about fifty miles back of the Spanish Peaks. I'm workin' a
      bunch of cattle; Cross-K is the brand; y'ear-marks a swallow-fork in the
      left, with the right y'ear onderhacked.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the good of a y'ear-mark when thar's a brand?" repeated the Old
      Cattleman after me, for I had interrupted with the question. "Whatever's
      the good of y'ear-marks? Why, when mixed cattle is in a bunch, standin' so
      close you can't see no brands on their sides, an' you-all is ridin'
      through the outfit cuttin' out, y'ear-marks is what you goes by. Cattle
      turns to look as you comes ridin' an' pesterin' among 'em, an' their two
      y'ears p'ints for'ard like fans. You gets their y'ear-marks like printin'
      on the page of a book. If you was to go over a herd by the brands, you
      wouldn't cut out a steer an hour. But to trail back after Boggs.

    <p>
      "`It's two months later, an' I'm ridin' down a draw one day,' says this
      Dan Boggs, 'cussin' the range an' the weather, when my pony goes to havin'
      symptoms. This yere pony is that sagacious that while it makes not the
      slightest mention of cattle when they's near, it never comes up on deer,
      or people in the hills, but it takes to givin' of manifestations. This is
      so I can squar myse'f for whatever game they opens on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`As I says, me an' this yere wise pony is pushin' out into the Caliente
      when the pony begins to make signs. I brings him down all cautious where

    </p>

    <p>
      you-all can gamble I'm some astonished to see a gent walkin' along afoot,
      off mebby a couple hundred yards. He sorter limps an' leans over on one
      side like he's hurt. Nacherally I stops an' surveys him careful. It's
      plenty strange he's thar at all; an' stranger still he's afoot. I looks
      him over for weepons; I wants to note what he's like an' how he's heeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You saveys as well as me it don't do to go canterin' out to strangers
      that a-way in the hills; speshully a stranger who's afoot. He might hunger
      for your pony for one thing, an' open a play on you with his gun, as would
      leave you afoot an' likewise too dead to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm allers cautious that a-way, around a party who's lost his hoss. It
      locoes him an' makes him f'rocious; I s'pose bein' afoot he feels
      he'pless, an' let out an' crazy. A gent afoot is a heap easier to
      aggravate, too; an' a mighty sight more likely to lay for you than when
      he's in a Texas saddle with a pony between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which is why I remarks, that I stacks up this pedestrian careful an'
      accurate before I goes after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As I says, he carries on like he's hurt; an' he's packin' a six-
      shooter. He seems familiar, too; an' while I looks him over I'm wonderin'
      where I cuts his trail before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As I has the advantage of a Winchester, I at last rides into the open
      an' gives a whoopee. The party turns, comes limpin' toward me, an' whoever
      do you allow it is? Which it's shorely Spanish Bill; an' it's right yere
      he gets action on that bread on the waters he plays in when he recovers me
      that time in Taos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To make it brief, Spanish Bill tells me that after I leaves Taos he goes
      over an' deals monte a bit at Wagon Mound. One night a Mexican comes
      caperin' in, an' Bill gives him a layout or two. At last he makes an alcy
      bet of fifty dollars on the queen; what the Greasers calls the "hoss." The
      Mexican loses; an' instead of takin' it easy like a sport should, he grabs
      the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As was his dooty, Spanish Bill bends his six-shooter over the Mexican.
      Tharupon he searches out a knife; an' this yere so complicates the
      business, Bill, to simplify things, plugs the Mexican full of holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This shootin' is on the squar', an' no one takes hostile notice of it.
      Spanish Bill goes on layin' out his monte same as usual. Two days later,
      though, he gets a p'inter the Mexicans is fixin' for him. So that night he
      moves camp&mdash;mebby to where it's a hundred an' sixty miles from Wagon
      Mound, over on the Vermejo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But it looks like the Greasers hangs to the trail; for the day before I
      tracks up on him a band of 'em hops outen a dry arroya, where they's
      bush-wackin' for him, an' goes to shootin'. As might be expected, Spanish
      Bill turns loose, free an' frequent, an' they all shorely has a high,
      excessive time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The Mexicans downs Spanish Bill's pony, an' a bullet creases Bill's
      side; which last is what curves him over an' indooces him to limp when I
      trails up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As Spanish Bill goes down, the Mexicans scatter. The game is too high
      for 'em. They was shy two people, with another plugged deep an' strong; by
      which you notes that Bill is aimin' low an' good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'After the shootin' Spanish Bill crawls over to a ranch, an', gettin' a
      pony an' saddle, which he easy does, he breaks back into the hills where I
      encounters him. It's that morning his pony gets tired of the deal, an'
      bucks him off, an' goes stampedin' back. That's why he's afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'While he's talkin' all this, I recalls how Spanish Bill rounds me up
      that night in Taos, so I don't hesitate. I takes him over to my camp. The
      next mornin' he turns his nose for Texas on my best pony; which is the
      last I sees or hears of Spanish Bill, onless he's the Bill who's lynched
      over near Eagle Pass a year later, of which I surmises it's some likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But whether Bill's lynched or not, it all brings up ag'in what that
      Gospel-gent says about doin' benev'lences; an' how after many days you
      dies an' makes a winnin', an' lives on velvet all eternity. An' don't you
      know this Spanish Bill pickin' me up that night, an' then in less than two
      months, when he's afoot an' hurt in the hills, gettin' ag'inst me an'
      drawin' out of the game ahead a saddle, a pony an' safety, makes it seem
      like that Bible-sharp is right a whole lot?
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's how it strikes me,' concloods Boggs. 'An' as I tells you; if so
      many cattle don't die that spring; an' if I don't give way so frightful in
      my talk, I'd shorely hunted down a congregation the next June, an' stood
      in."'

      CHAPTER XVIII. DAWSON &amp; RUDD, PARTNERS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Whatever's the difference between the East an' the West?" said the Old
      Cattleman, repeating my question rather for the purpose of consideration
      than from any failure to understand: "What's the difference between the
      East an' the West? Which, so far as I notes, to relapse into metaphor, as
      you-alls says, the big difference is that the East allers shoots from a
      rest; while the West shoots off hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The West shore learns easy an' is quick to change a system or alter a
      play. It's plumb swift, the West is; an' what some regards as rough is
      mere rapidity. The West might go broke at faro-bank in the mornin', an' be
      rich at roulette in the afternoon; you can't tell. I knows partners in
      Arizona who rolls out in the gray light of breakin' day an' begins work by
      dissolvin' an' windin' up the firm's affairs. By dark them same gents is
      pards ag'in in a new enterprise complete. Folks'll fight at sun-up an'
      cook their chile con carne together at night, an' then sleep onder the
      same blankets. For which causes thar's no prophets in the West; a Western
      future that a-way bein' so mighty oncertain no prophet can fasten his
      lariat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speakin' of pards an' the fog which surrounds what the same is likely to
      do, makes me think of the onlicensed an' onlooked-for carryin's-on of
      'Doby Dawson an' Copper Queen Billy Rudd. Them two gents fosters a feud
      among themse'fs that splits 'em wide open an' keeps 'em pesterin' each
      other for years; which the doin's of them locoed people is the scandal of
      Wolfville while it lasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's mebby the spring after we erects the Bird Cage Op'ry House, an'
      Wolfville is gettin' to be considerable of a camp. We-alls is organized
      for a shore-'nough town, an Jack Moore is a shore-'nough marshal, with
      Enright for alcalde that a-way, an' thar's a heap of improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I first tracks into Wolfville, cows is what you might call the
      leadin' industry, with whiskey an' faro-bank on the side. But in the days
      of 'Doby Dawson an' Copper Queen Billy Rudd, ore has been onearthed, the
      mines is opened, an' Wolfville's swelled tremendous. We-alls even wins a
      county-seat fight with Red Dog, wherein we puts it all over that ornery
      hamlet; an' we shorely deals the game for the entire region.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I states, it's the spring after we promotes the Bird Cage Op'ry House&mdash;which
      temple of amoosements is complete the fall before&mdash;that 'Doby an'
      Billy turns up in Wolfville. I knows she's spring, for I'm away workin'
      the round-up at the time, an' them gents is both thar drunk when I comes
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Doby an' Billy's been pards for ten years. They's miner folks, an' 'Doby
      tells me himse'f one day that him an' Billy has stood in on every mine
      excitement from Alaska to Lower Californy. An' never once does they get
      their trails crossed or have a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The two gents strikes at Wolfville when the mines is first opened, an'
      stakes out three claims; one for 'Doby, one for Billy. an' one for both of
      'em. They's camped off up a draw about half a mile from town, where their
      claims is, an' has a little cabin an' seems to be gettin' along peaceful
      as a church; an' I reckons thar's' no doubt but they be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When 'Doby an' Billy first comes caperin' into Wolfville they's that
      thick an' friendly with each other, it's a shame to thieves. I recalls how
      their relations that a-way excites general admiration, an' Doc Peets even
      goes so far he calls 'em 'Jonathan an' David.' Which Peets would have kept
      on callin' 'em 'Jonathan an' David' plumb through, but Billy gets hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It ain't me I cares for,' says Billy,&mdash;which he waits on Doc Peets
      with his gun,&mdash;'but no gent's goin' to malign 'Doby Dawson none an'
      alloode to him as 'Jonathan' without rebooke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seein' it pains Billy, an' as thar ain't even a white chip in mere
      nomenclature that a-way, of course Doc Peets don't call 'em 'Jonathan an'
      David' no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Doby an' Billy's been around mighty likely six months. The camp gets
      used to 'em an' likes 'em. They digs an' blasts away in them badger-holes
      they calls shafts all day, an' then comes chargin' down to the Red Light
      at night. After the two is drunk successful, they mutually takes each
      other home. An' as they lines out for their camp upholdin' an' he'pin' of
      each other, an' both that dead soaked in nose-paint they long before
      abandons tryin' to he'p themse'fs, I tells you, son, their love is a
      picture an' a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the way them pore, locoed sots,' says Old Man Enright one night,
      as 'Doby an' Billy falls outen the Red Light together, an' then turns in
      an' assists each other to rise,&mdash;'which the way them pore darkened
      drunkards rides herd on each other, an' is onse'fish an' generous that
      a-way, an' backs each other's play, is as good as sermons. You-all young
      men,' says Enright, turnin' on Jack Moore an' Boggs an' Tutt, 'you-all
      imatoor bucks whose character ain't really formed none yet, oughter profit
      plenty by their example.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I remarks, 'Doby an' Billy's been inhabitin' Wolfville for mighty hard
      on six months when the trouble between 'em first shows its teeth. As Billy
      walks out one mornin' to sniff the climate some, he remarks a Mexican&mdash;which
      his name is Jose Salazar, but don't cut no figger nohow&mdash;sorter
      'propriatin' of a mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The same,' as Billy says, in relatin' the casooalty later, 'bein' our
      star mule.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nacherally, on notin' the misdeeds of this yere Greaser, Billy reaches
      inside the cabin, an' sorts out a Winchester an' plugs said culprit in
      among his thoughts, an tharby brings his mule-rustlin' an' his reflections
      to a pause some.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's two hours later, mebby, when the defunct's daughter&mdash;the outfit
      abides over in Chihuahua, which is the Mexican part of Wolfville&mdash;goes
      to a show-down with 'Doby an' Billy an wants to know does she get the
      corpse?
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shore,' says 'Doby, 'which we-alls has no further use for your paw, an'
      his remainder is free an' welcome to you. You can bet me an' Billy ain't
      holdin' out no paternal corpses none on their weepin' offsprings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Followin' of his bluff, 'Doby goes over an' consoles with the Mexican's
      daughter, which her name's Manuela, an' she don't look so bad neither. Doc
      Peets, whose jedgement of females is a cinch, allows she's as pretty as a
      diamond flush, an' you can gamble Doc Peets ain't makin no blind leads
      when it's a question of squaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So 'Doby consoles this yere Manuela a whole lot, while Billy, who's
      makin' coffee an' bakin'. powder biscuit inside, don't really notice he's
      doin' it. Fact is, Billy's plumb busy. The New York Store havin' changed
      bakin'-powder onto us the week before&mdash;the same redoocin' biscuits to
      a conundrum for a month after&mdash;an' that bakin'-powder change sorter
      engagin' Billy's faculties wholly, he forgets about deceased an' his
      daughter complete; that is, complete temporary. Later, when the biscuits
      is done an' offen his mind, Billy recalls all about it ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But 'Doby, who's a good talker an' a mighty tender gent that a- way,
      jumps in an' comforts Manuela, an' shows her how this mule her paw is
      stealin' is by way an' far the best mule in camp, an' at last she dries
      her tears an' allows in her language that she's growin' resigned. 'Doby
      winds up by he'pin' Manuela home with what's left of her paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which it's jest like that 'Doby,' says Billy, when he hears of his
      partner packin' home his prey that a-way, an' his tones shows he admires
      'Doby no limit, `which it's shorely like him. Take folks in distress, an'
      you-alls can bet your last chip 'Doby can't do too much for 'em.' "Billy's
      disgust sets in like the rainy season, however, when about two months
      later 'Doby ups an' weds this Mexican girl Manuela. When Billy learns of
      said ceremony, he declines a seat in the game, an' won't go near them
      nuptials nohow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' I declar's myse'f right yere,' says Billy. 'From now for'ard it's a
      case of lone hand with me. I don't want no more partners. When a gent with
      whom for ten years I've camped, trailed, an' prospected with, all the way
      from the Dalls to the Gila, quits me cold an' clammy for a squaw he don't
      know ten weeks, you can gamble that lets me plumb out. I've done got my
      med'cine. an' I'm ready to quit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But 'Doby an' Billy don't actooally make no assignment, nor go into what
      you-all Eastern sharps calls liquidation. The two goes on an' works their
      claims together, an' the firm name still waves as 'Doby Dawson an' Copper
      Queen Billy Rudd,' only Billy won't go into 'Doby's new wickeyup where
      he's got Manuela,&mdash;not a foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I might have conquered my native reluctance,' says Billy, 'so to
      do, an' I even makes up my mind one night&mdash;it's after I've got my
      grub, an' you-alls knows how plumb soft an' forgivin' that a- way a gent
      is when his stomach's full of grub&mdash;to go up an' visit 'em a lot. But
      as I gets to the door I hears a noise I don't savey; an' when I Injuns up
      to a crack an' surveys the scene, I'm a coyote if thar ain't 'Doby, with
      his wife in his lap, singin' to her. That's squar'; actooally singin';
      which sech efforts reminds me of ballards by cinnamon b'ars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I ain't none shore,' goes on Billy, as he relates about it to me, 'but
      I'd stood sech egreegious plays, chargin' it general to 'Doby's gettin'
      locoed an' mushy; but when this yere ingrate ends his war- song, what do
      you-all reckon now he does? Turns in an' begins 'pologizin' for me downin'
      her dad. Which the old hold-up is on the mule an' goin' hell-bent when I
      curls him up. Well, that ends things with me. I turns on my heels an' goes
      down to the Red Light an' gets drunk plumb through. You recalls it; the
      time I'm drunk a month, an' Cherokee Hall bars me at faro-bank, allowin'
      I'm onconscious of my surroundin's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy goes on livin' at their old camp, an' 'Doby an' Manuela at the new
      one 'Doby built. This last is mebby four hundred yards more up the draw.
      Durin' the day 'Doby an' Billy turns in an' works an' digs an' drills an'
      blasts together as of yore. The main change is that at evenin' Billy gets
      drunk alone; an' as 'Doby ain't along to he'p Billy home an' need Billy's
      he'p to get home, lots of times Billy falls by the trail an' puts in the
      night among the mesquite- bushes an' the coyotes impartial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere goes on for plumb a year, an' while things is cooler an' more
      distant between 'em, same as it's bound to be when two gents sleeps in
      different camps, still 'Doby an' Billy is trackin' along all right. One
      mornin', however, Billy goes down to the holes they's projectin' over, but
      no 'Doby shows up. It goes on ontil mighty likely fifth-drink time that
      forenoon, an' as Billy don't see no trace, sign, nor signal-smoke of his
      pard, he gets oneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a fact,' says Billy afterward, 'thar's hours when I more'n half
      allows this yere squaw of 'Doby's has done took a knife, or some sech
      weepon, an' gets even with 'Doby, while he sleeps, for me pluggin' her paw
      about the mule. It's this yere idee which takes me outen the shaft I'm
      sinkin', an' sends me cavortin' up to 'Doby's camp. I passes a resolution
      on my way that if she's cashed 'Doby's chips for him that a-way, I'll
      shorely sa'nter over an' lay waste all Chihuahua to play even for the
      blow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as all turns out, them surmises of Billy's is idle. He gets mebby
      easy six-shooter distance from the door, when he discerns a small cry like
      a fox-cub's whine. Billy listens, an' the yelp comes as cl'ar on his years
      as the whistle of a curlew. Billy tumbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm a Chinaman,' says Billy, 'if it ain't a kid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he backs off quiet an' noiseless ontil he's dead safe, an' then he
      lifts the long yell for 'Doby. When 'Doby emerges he confirms them beliefs
      of Billy's; it's a kid shore-'nough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Boy or girl?' says Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Boy,' says 'Doby.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I shorely quits you cold if it's a girl; says Billy. 'As it is, I
      stands by you in your troubles. I ain't none s'prised at your luck,
      'Doby,' goes on Billy. ` I half foresees some sech racket as this the
      minute you gets married. However, if it's a boy she goes. I ain't the gent
      to lay down on an old-time runnin'-mate while luck's ag'in him; an' I'll
      still be your partner an' play out my hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, 'Doby has to go back to lookout his game. An' as Billy's that
      rent an' shaken by them news he can't work none, he takes two or three
      drinks of nose-paint, an' then promulgates as how it's a holiday. Billy
      feels, too, that while this yere's a blow, still it's a great occasion;
      an' as he takes to feelin' his whiskey an' roominatin' on the tangled
      state of affairs, it suddenly strikes him he'll jest nacherally close up
      the trail by the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Women is frail people an' can't abide noises that a-way,' says Billy, `
      an' 'Doby's shore lookin' some faded himse'f. I reckons, tharfore, I'll
      sorter stop commerce along this yere thoroughfar' ontil further orders.
      What 'Doby an' his squaw needs now is quietood an' peace, an' you can
      wager all you-alls is worth they ain't goin' to suffer no disturbances.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't half an hour after this before Billy's got two signs, both down
      an' up the trail, warnin' of people to hunt another wagon- track. The
      signs is made outen pine boards, an' Billy has marked this yere motto onto
      'em with a burnt stick
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"'DOBY'S GOT A PAPOOSE,
 SO
 PULL YOUR FREIGHT."
</pre>
    <p>
      "It ain't no time after Billy posts his warnin's, an' he's still musin'
      over 'em mighty reflective, when along projects a Mexican with a pair of
      burros he's packin' freight on. The Mexican's goin' by the notices witbout
      payin' the least heed tharto. But this don't do Billy, an' he stands him
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Can you read?' says Billy to the Mexican, at the same time p'intin' to
      the signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Mexican allows in Spanish&mdash;which the same Billy saveys an'
      palavers liberal&mdash;that he can't read. Then he p'ints out to go by
      ag'in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No you don't none, onless in the smoke; says Billy, an' throws a gun on
      him. 'Pause where you be, my proud Castilian, an' I'll flood your darkened
      ignorance with light by nacherally readin' this yere inscription to you a
      whole lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tharupon Billy reads off the notice a heap impressive, an' winds up by
      commandin' of the Mexican to line out on the trail back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Vamos!' says Billy. 'Which if you insists on pushin' along through yere
      I'll turn in an' crawl your hump some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Mexican gets ugly as a t'ran'tler at this, an' with one motion he
      lugs out a six-shooter an' onbosoms the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy is a trifle previous with a gun himse'f, an' while the Mexican is
      mighty abrupt, he gets none the best of Billy. Which the outcome is the
      Mexican's shot plumb dead in his moccasins, while Billy takes a small
      crease on his cheek, the same not bein' deadly. Billy then confiscates the
      burros.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I plays 'em in for funeral expenses,' says Billy, an' is turnin'
      of 'em into the corral by his camp jest as 'Doby comes prancin' out with a
      six-shooter to take part in whatever game is bein' rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When 'Doby sees Billy's signs that a-way, he's 'fected so he weeps tears.
      He puts his hands on Billy's shoulder, an' lookin' at him, while his eyes
      is swimmin', he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Billy, you-all is the thoughtfullest pard that ever lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Doby throws so much soul into it, an' him givin' 'way to emotions, it
      comes mighty near onhingin' Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I knows I be,' he says, shakin' 'Doby by the hand for a minute, 'but,
      Old Man, you deserves it. It's comin' to you, an' you bet your life you're
      goin' to get it. With some folks this yere would be castin' pearls before
      swine, but not with you, 'Doby. You can 'preciate a play, an' I'm proud to
      be your partner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next few months goes on, an' 'Doby an' Billy keeps peggin' away at
      their claims, an' gettin' drunk an' rich about equal. Billy is still that
      reedic'lous he won't go up to 'Doby's camp; but 'Doby comes over an' sees
      him frequent. The first throw out of the box Billy takes a notion ag'in
      the kid an' allows he don't want no traffic with him,&mdash;none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But 'Doby won't have it that a-way, an' when it's about six months old he
      packs said infant over one mornin' while Billy's at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ain't he hell!' says 'Doby, a heap gleeful, at the same time sawin' the
      infant onto Billy direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course Billy has to hold him then. Which he acts like he's a hot
      tamale, an' shifts him about in his arms. But it's plain he ain't so
      displeased neither. At last the kid reaches out swift an' cinches onto
      Billy's beard that a-way. This delights Billy, while 'Doby keeps trackin'
      'round the room too tickled to set down. All he can remark&mdash;an' he
      does it frequent, like it tells the entire story&mdash;is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Billy, ain't he hell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' Billy ain't none back'ard admittin' he is, an' allows on hesitatin'
      it's the hunkiest baby in Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' I've got dust into the thousands,' remarks Billy, 'which says he's
      the prize papoose of the reservation, an' says it ten to one. This yere
      offspring is a credit to you, 'Doby, an' I marvels you-all is that modest
      over it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You can bet it ain't no Siwash,' says 'Doby. 'It's clean strain, that
      infant is, if I does say it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever.' says Billy. looking the infant over an' beginnin' to
      feel as proud of it as 'Doby himse'f, 'that's whatever. An' I'm yere to
      remark, any gent who can up an' without no talk or boastin' have such a
      papoose as that, is licensed to plume himse'f tharon, an' put on dog over
      it, the same without restraint. If ever you calls the turn for the limit,
      pard, it's when you has this yere child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this 'Doby an' Billy shakes hands like it's a ceremony, an' both is
      grave an' dignified about it. 'Doby puts it up that usual he's beyond
      flattery, but when a gent of jedgement like Billy looks over a play that
      a-way, an' indorses it, you can bet he's not insensible. Then they shakes
      hands ag'in, an' 'Doby says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Moreover, not meanin' no compliments, nor tossin' of no boquets, old
      pard, me an' Manuela names this young person "Willyum"; same as you-all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy comes mighty near droppin' the infant on the floor at this, an' the
      small victim of his onthoughtfulness that a-way yells like a coyote.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That settles it,' says Billy. 'A gent who could come down to blastin'
      an' drillin'&mdash;mere menial tasks, as they shorely be&mdash;on the
      heels of honor like this, is a mighty sight more sordid than Copper Queen
      Billy Rudd. 'Doby, this yere is a remarkable occasion, an' we cel'brates.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "By this time the infant is grown plumb hostile, an' is howlin' to beat
      the band; so 'Doby puts it up he'll take him to his mother an' afterwards
      he's ready to join Billy in an orgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I jest nacherally stampedes back to the agency with this yere Willyum
      child,' says 'Doby, an' then we-alls repairs to the Red Light an'
      relaxes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shorely does-I don't recall no sech debauch&mdash;that is, none so
      extreme an' broadcast&mdash;since Wolfville and Red Dog engages in them
      Thanksgiviin' exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doby an' Billy, as time goes by, allers alloods to the infant as
      'Willyum,' so's not to get him an' Billy mixed; an' durin' the next two
      years, while Billy still goes shy so far as trackin' over to 'Doby's ranch
      is concerned, as soon as he walks, Willyum comes down the canyon to see
      Billy every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, Billy ain't none onforgivin' to Manuela for ropin' up 'Doby an'
      weddin' him that a-way; but you see downin' her paw for stealin' the mule
      that time gets so it makes him bashful an' reluctant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It ain't that I'm timorous neither, nor yet assoomin' airs,' this yere
      Billy says to me when he brings it up himse'f how he don't go over to
      'Doby's, 'but I'm never no hand to set 'round an' visit free an' easy that
      a-way with the posterity of a gent which I has had cause to plant. This
      yere ain't roodness; it's scrooples,' says Billy, 'an' so it's plumb
      useless for me to go gettin' sociable with 'Doby's wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's crowdin' close on two years after the infant's born when 'Doby an'
      Billy gets up their feud which I speaks of at the beginnin'. Yere's how it
      gets fulminated. Billy's loafin' over by the post- office door one
      evenin', talkin' to Tutt an' Boggs an' a passel of us, when who comes
      projectin' along, p'intin' for the New York Store, but 'Doby's wife an'
      Willyum. As they trails by, Willyum sees Billy&mdash;Willyum can make a
      small bluff at talkin' by now&mdash;an', p'intin' his finger at Billy, he
      sags back on his mother's dress like he aims to halt her, an' says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pop-pa! Pop-pa!' meanin' Billy that a-way; although the same is
      erroneous entire, as every gent in Wolfville knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if Willyum's forefinger he p'ints with
    </p>
    <p>
      is a Colt's forty-four, an' instead of sayin' `Poppa!' he onhooks the same
      at Billy direct, now I don't reckon Billy could have been more put out.
      'Doby's wife drags Willyum along at the time like he's a calf goin' to be
      branded, an' she never halts or pauses. But Billy turns all kinds of hues,
      an' is that prostrated he surges across to the Red Light an' gets two
      drinks alone, never invitin' nobody, before he realizes. When he does
      invite us he admits frank he's plumb locoed for a moment by the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You bet!' says Billy, as he gets his third drink, the same bein' took in
      common with the pop'lace present, 'you bet! thar ain't a gent in camp I'd
      insult by no neglect; but when Willyum makes them charges an' does it
      publicly, it onhinges my reason, an' them two times I don't invite
      you-alls, I'm not responsible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We-alls sees Billy's wounded, an' tharfore it's a ha'r-line deal to say
      anythin'; but as well as we can we tells him that what Willyum says, that
      a-way, bein' less'n two year old, is the mere prattle of a child, an' he's
      not to be depressed by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sech breaks,' says Dan Boggs, 'is took jocose back in the States.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shore!' says Texas Thompson, backin' Boggs's play; 'them little bluffs
      of infancy, gettin' tangled that a-way about their progenitors, is
      regarded joyous in Laredo. Which thar's not the slightest need of Billy
      bein' cast down tharat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I ain't sayin' a word, gents,' remarks Billy, an' his tones is sad.
      You-alls means proper an friendly. But I warns the world at this time that
      I now embarks on the spree of my life. I'm goin to get drunk an' never
      hedge a bet; an my last requests, the same bein' addressed to the barkeep,
      personal, is to set every bottle of bug- juice in the shebang on the bar,
      thar to repose within the reach of all ontil further orders.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's about an hour later, an' Billy, who's filed away a quart of
      fire-water in his interior by now, is vibratin' between the Red Light an'
      the dance-hall, growin' drunk an' dejected even up. It's then he sees
      'Doby headin' up the street. 'Doby hears of his son Willyum's wild play
      from his wife, an' it makes him hot that a-way. But he ain't no notion of
      blamin' Billy; none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, 'Doby don't have entire charge of the round-up, an' he has to
      figger with Billy right along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Doby,' shouts Billy, as he notes his pard approachin', while he balances
      himse'f in his moccasins a heap difficult, ''Doby, your infant Willyum is
      a eediot. Which if I was the parent of a fool papoose like Willyum, I'd
      shorely drop him down a shaft a whole lot an' fill up the shaft. He won't
      assay two ounces of sense to the ton, Willyum won't; an' he ain't worth
      powder an' fuse to work him. Actooally, that pore imbecile baby Willyum,
      don't know his own father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the rage of 'Doby is beyond bounds complete. For about half a
      minute him an' Billy froths an' cusses each other out scand'lous, an' then
      comes the guns. The artillery is a case of s'prise, the most experienced
      gent in Wolfville not loekin' for no gun-play between folks who's been
      pards an' blanket-mates for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, it don't last long; it looks like both gets sorter
      conscience-stricken that a-way, an' lets up. Still, while it's short, it's
      long enough for Billy to get his laig ousted with one of 'Doby's bullets,
      an' it all lays Billy up for Doc Peets to fuss with for over three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While Billy's stretched out, an' Doe Peets is ridin' herd on his laig,
      'Doby keeps as savage as an Apache an' don't come near Billy. The same,
      however, ain't full proof of coldness, neither; for Billy's done give it
      out he'll down 'Doby if he pokes his head in the door, an' arranges his
      guns where he can work 'em in on the enterprise easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Willyum don't take no stand-off. The last thing Willyum's afraid of
      is Billy; so he comes waltzin' over each day, clumsy as a cub cinnamon on
      his short laigs, an' makes himse'f plumb abundant. He plays with Billy,
      an' he sleeps with Billy, Willyum does; an' he eats every time the nigger,
      who's come over from the corral to lookout Billy's domestic game while
      he's down, rustles some grub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Doby's disgusted with Willyum's herdin' 'round with Billy that a- way,
      bein' sociable an' visitin' of him, an' he lays for Willyum an' wallops
      him. When Billy learns of it&mdash;which he does from Willyum himse'f when
      that infant p'ints in for a visit the day after&mdash;he's as wild as a
      mountain lion. Billy can't get out none, for his laig is a heap
      fragmentary as yet,&mdash;'Doby's bullet gettin' all the results which is
      comin' that time,&mdash;but he sends 'Doby word by Peets, if he hears of
      any more punishments bein' meted to Willyum, he regards it as a speshul
      affront to him, an' holds 'Doby responsible personal as soon as he can
      hobble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tell him,' says Billy, 'that if he commits any further atrocities ag'in
      this innocent Willyum child, I'll shore leave him too dead to skin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere Billy's gettin' locoed entire,' says Enright, when he's told
      of Billy's bluff. 'The right to maul your immediate descendants that a-way
      is guaranteed by the constitootion, an' is one of them things we-alls
      fights for at Bunker Hill. However, I reckons Billy's merely blowin' his
      horn; bein' sick an' cantankerous with his game knee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy gets well after a while, an' him an' 'Doby sorter plans to avoid
      each other. Whatever work they puts in on the claim they holds in
      partnership, they hires other gents to do. Personal, each works the claim
      he holds himse'f, which keeps 'em asunder a whole lot, an' is frootful of
      peace.' "Deep inside their shirts I allers allows these yere persons deems
      high an' 'fectionate of one another right at the time they's hangin' up
      their hardest bluffs an' carryin' on most hostile. Which trivial incidents
      discloses this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once in the Red Light, when a party who's new from Tucson, turns in to
      tell some light story of Billy,&mdash;him not bein' present none,&mdash;
      'Doby goes all over this yere racontoor like a landslide, an' retires him
      from s'ciety for a week. An' 'Doby don't explain his game neither; jest
      reprimands this offensive Tucson gent, an' lets it go as it lays. Of
      course, we-alls onderstands it's 'cause 'Doby ain't puttin' up with no
      carpin' criticism of his old pard; which the same is nacheral enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you-all ever notice, son, how once you takes to fightin' for a
      party an' indorsin' of his plays, it gets to be a habit,&mdash;same,
      mebby, as fire-water? Which you lays for his detractors an' pulls on war
      for him that a-way long after you ceases to have the slightest use for him
      yourse'f. It's that a-way with 'Doby about Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' this yere Billy's feelin's about 'Doby is heated an' sedulous all
      sim'lar. 'Doby gets laid out for a week by rheumatics, which he acquires
      years before&mdash;he shore don't rope onto them rheumatics none 'round
      Wolfville, you can gamble! said camp bein' salooberous that a-way&mdash;over
      on the Nevada plateaus, an' while he's treed an' can't come down to his
      claim, a passel of sharps ups an' mavericks it; what miners calls 'jumps
      it.' Whatever does Billy do? Paints for war prompt an' enthoosiastic,
      takes his gun, an' the way he stampedes an' scatters them marauders don't
      bother him a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But while, as I states, this yere trick of makin' war-med'cine which
      'Doby an' Billy has, an' schedoolin' trouble for folks who comes
      projectin' 'round invadin' of the other's rights, mebby is a heap habit, I
      gleans from it the idee likewise that onder the surface they holds each
      other in esteem to a p'int which is romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doby an' Billy lives on for a year after 'Doby plugs Billy in the laig,
      keepin' wide apart an' not speakin'. Willyum is got so he puts in most of
      his nights an' all of his days with Billy; which the spectacle of Billy
      packin' Willyum about camp nights is frequent. 'Doby never 'pears to file
      no protest; I reckons he looks on it as a fore-ordained an' hopeless play.
      However, Billy's a heap careful of Willyum's morals, an' is shorely linin'
      him up right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once a new barkeep in the dance-hall allows he'll promote Willyum's
      feelin's some with a spoonful of nose-paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, you don't,' says Billy, plenty savage; 'an' since the matter comes
      up I announces cold that, now or yereafter, the first gent who saws off
      nose-paint on Willyum, or lays for the morals of this innocent infant to
      corrupt 'em, I'll kill an' skelp him so shore as I packs gun or knife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which shows,' said Dan Boggs later, when he hears of Billy's blazer,
      'that this yere Billy Rudd is a mighty high-minded gent, an' you-alls can
      play it to win he has my regards. He can count me in on this deal to keep
      Willyum from strong drinks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I thinks myse'f he's right,' says Cherokee Hall. 'Willyum is now but
      three years old, which is shore not aged. My idee would be to raise
      Willyum, an' not let him drink a drop of nose-paint ever, merely to show
      the camp what comes of sech experiments.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Billy's that pos'tive an' self-reliant he don't need no encouragement
      about how he conducts Willyum's habits; an', followin' his remarks,
      Willyum allers gets ignored complete on invitations to licker. Packin' the
      kid 'round that a-way shortens up Billy's booze a lot, too. He don't feel
      so free to get tanked expansive with Willyum on his mind an' hands that
      a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's shorely a picture, the tenderness Billy lavishes on Willyum. Many a
      night when Billy's stayin' late, tryin' to win himse'f outen the hole, I
      beholds him playin' poker, or mebby it's farebank, with Willyum curled up
      on his lap an' shirt-front, snorin' away all sound an' genial, an' Billy
      makin' his raises an' callin' his draw to the dealer in whispers, for fear
      he wakes Willyum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But thar comes a time when the feud is over, an' 'Doby an' Billy turns in
      better friends than before. For a month mebby thar's a Mexican girl&mdash;which
      she's a cousin that a-way or some kin to 'Doby's wife&mdash;who's been
      stayin' at 'Doby's house, sorter backin' their play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It falls out frequent this Mexican girl, Marie, trails over to Billy's,
      roundin' up an' collectin' of Willyum to put another shirt onto him, or
      some sech benefit. Billy never acts like he's impressed by this yere girl,
      an', while he relinquishes Willyum every time, he growls an' puts it up
      he's malev'lent over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the seniorita is game, an' don't put no store by Billy's growls. She
      ropes up Willyum an' drags him away mighty decisive. Willyum howls an'
      calls on Billy for aid, which most likely is pain to Billy's heart; but he
      don't get it none. The senorita harnesses Willyum into a clean shirt, an'
      then she throws Willyum loose on the range ag'in, an' he drifts back to
      Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the general view that Billy never once thinks of wedlock with the
      senorita if he's let alone. But one day Doc Peets waxes facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In a month,' says Peets to Billy, while we-alls is renooin' our spcrits
      in the Red Light, 'this yere Marie'll quit comin' over for Willyum.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why?' says Billy, glarin' at Peets s'picious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cause,' replies Peets, all careless, ''cause you ups an' weds her by
      then. I sees it in your eye. Then, when she's thar for good, I reckons she
      nacherally quits comin' over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, I don't know,' says Texas Thompson, who's takin' in Doc Peets'
      remark; ' I don't allow Billy's got the nerve to marry this yere Marie.
      Not but what she's as pretty as an antelope. But think of 'Doby. He jest
      never would quit chewin' Billy's mane if he goes pullin' off any nuptial
      ceremonies with his wife's relative that a- way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billy looks hard as granite at this. He ain't sayin' nothin', but he gets
      outside of another drink in a way which shows his mind's made up, an' then
      he goes p'intin' off towards his camp, same as a gent who entertains
      designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I offers three to one,' says Cherokee Hall, lookin' after Billy sorter
      thoughtful that a-way, 'that Billy weds this yere Mexican girl in a week;
      an' I'll go five hundred dollars even money he gets her before night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' no takers,' says Doc Peets, 'for I about thinks you calls the turn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that's what happens. In two hours after this impulsive Billy prances
      out of the Red Light on the heels of Texas Thompson's remarks about how
      hostile 'Doby would be if he ever gets Marie, he's done lured her before
      the padre over in Chihuahua, an' the padre marries 'em as quick as you
      could take a runnin'-iron an' burn a brand on a calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which this is not all. Like they was out to add to the excitement a
      whole lot, I'm a Mohave if 'Doby an' his wife don't turn loose an' have
      another infant that same day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I never sees a gent get so excited over another gent's game as Billy
      does over 'Doby's number two. He sends his new wife up to 'Doby's on the
      run, while he takes Willyum an' comes pirootin' back to the Red Light to
      brace up. Billy's shore nervous an' needs it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My pore child,' says Billy to Willyum about the third drink&mdash;
      Willyum is settin' on a monte-table an' payin' heed to Billy a heap
      decorous an' respectful for a three-year-old&mdash;'my pore child,' says
      Billy that a-way, 'you-all is ag'in a hard game up at your paw's. This
      yere is playin' it plumb low on you, Willyum. It looks like they fills a
      hand ag'in you, son, an' you ain't in it no more at 'Doby's; who, whatever
      is your fool claims on that p'int a year ago, is still your dad ondoubted.
      But you-all knows me, Willyum. You knows that talk in Holy Writ. If your
      father an' mother shakes you, your Uncle Billy takes you up. I'm powerful
      'fraid, Willyum, you'll have to have action on them promises."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willyum listens to Billy plenty grave an' owly, but he don't make no
      observations on his luck or communicate no views to Billy except that he's
      hungry. This yere ain't relevant none, but Billy at once pastures him out
      on a can of sardines an' some crackers, while he keeps on bein' liberal to
      himse'f about whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't feel like denyin' myse'f nothin',' he says. 'Yere I gets
      married, an' in less'n an hour my wife is ravaged away at the whoop of
      dooty to ride herd on another gent's fam'ly,; leavin' me, her husband,
      with that other gent's abandoned progeny on my hands. This yere's gettin'
      to be a boggy ford for Billy Rudd, you bet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "But while Billy takes on a heap, he don't impress me like he's hurt none
      after all. When Doc Peets trails in from 'Doby's, where he's been in the
      interests of science that a-way, Billy at once drug him aside for a
      pow-wow. They talks over in one corner of the Red Light awhile, then Billy
      looks up like one load's offen his mind, an' yells:
    </p>
    <p>
      " 'Barkeep, it's another boy. Use my name freely in urgin' drinks on the
      camp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Billy goes on whisperin' to Doc Peets an' layin' down somethin',
      like his heart's sot on it. At last Doc says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The best way, Billy, is for me to bring 'Doby over.' With this Doc Peets
      gets onto his pony at the door an' goes curvin' back to 'Doby's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a boy,' says Billy to the rest of us after Doc Peets lines out,
      `an' child an' mother both on velvet an' winnin' right along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "These yere events crowdin' each other that a-way&mdash;first a weddin'
      an' then an infant boy&mdash;has a brightenin' effect on public sperit. It
      makes us feel like the camp's shorely gettin' a start. While we- alls is
      givin' way to Billy's desire to buy whiskey, Peets comes back, bringin'
      'Doby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's nothin' what you-alls calls dramatic about 'Doby an' Billy comin'
      together. They meets an' shakes, that's all. They takes a drink together,
      which shows they's out to be friends for good, an' then Billy says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But what I wants partic'lar, 'Doby, is that you makes over to me your
      son Willyum. He's shore the finest young-one in Arizona, an' Marie an' me
      needs him to sorter organize on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Billy,' says 'Doby, 'you-all an' me is partners for years, an' we're
      partners yet. We has our storm cloud, an' we has also our eras of peace.
      Standin' as we do on the brink of one of said eras, an' as showin'
      sincerity, I yereby commits to you my son Willyum. Yereafter, when he
      calls you "Pop," it goes, an' the same will not be took invidious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "''Doby,' replies Billy, takin' him by the hand, 'this yere day 'lustrates
      the prophet when he says: "In the midst of life we're in luck." If you-all
      notes tears in my eyes I'm responsible for 'em. Willyum's mine. As I r'ars
      him it will be with you as a model. Now you go back where dooty calls you.
      When you ceases to need my wife, Marie, send her back to camp, an' notify
      me tharof. Pendin' of which said notice, however,' concloods Billy,
      turnin' to us after 'Doby starts back, 'Willyum an' me entertains.'"

      CHAPTER XIX. MACE BOWMAN, SHERIFF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "And so you think the trouble lies with the man and not with the whiskey?"
      I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman and I were discussing "temperance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right you be. This yere whiskey-drinkin'," continued the old gentleman as
      he toyed with his empty glass, "is a mighty cur'ous play. I knows gents as
      can tamper with their little old forty drops frequent an' reg'lar. As far
      as hurtin' of 'em is concerned, it don't come to throwin' water on a
      drowned rat. Then, ag'in, I've cut gents's trails as drinkin' whiskey is
      like playin' a harp with a hammer. Which we-alls ain't all upholstered
      alike; that's whatever. We don't all show the same brands an' y'earmarks
      nohow: What's med'cine for one is p'isen for t'other; an' thar you be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bein' a reg'lar, reliable drunkard that a-way comes mighty near bein' a
      disease. It ain't no question of nerve, neither. Some dead- game gents I
      knows&mdash;an' who's that obstinate they wouldn't move camp for a
      prairie-fire&mdash;couldn't pester a little bit with whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's my friend, Mace Bowman. Mace is clean strain cl'ar through, an'
      yet I don't reckon he ever gets to a show-down with whiskey once which he
      ain't outheld. But for grim nerve as'll never shiver, this yere Bowman is
      at par every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bowman dies a prey to his ambition. He starts in once to drink all the
      whiskey in Wolfville. By his partic'lar request most of the white male
      people of the camp stands in on the deal, a-backin' his play for to make
      Wolfville a dry camp. At the close of them two lurid weeks Mace lasts,
      good jedges, like Enright an' Doc Peets, allows he's shorely made it
      scarce some.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Wolfville's too big for him. Any other gent but Mace would have roped
      at a smaller outfit, but that wouldn't be Mace nohow. If thar's a bigger
      camp than Wolfville anywhere about, that's where he'd been. He's mighty
      high-hearted an' ambitious that a-way, an' it's kill a bull or nothin'
      when he lines out for buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the thirteenth day, he strikes in on the big trail, where you never
      meets no outfits comin' back, an' that settles it. The boys, not havin' no
      leader, with Mace petered, gives up the game, an' the big raid on
      nose-paint in Wolfville is only hist'ry now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I knows Bowman first he's sheriff over in northeast New Mexico. A
      good sheriff Mace is, too. Thar ain't nothin' gets run off while he's
      sheriff, you bet. When he allows anythin's his dooty, he lays for it
      permiscus. He's a plumb sincere offishul that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One time I recalls as how a wagon-train with households of folks into it
      camps two or three days where Mace is sheriff. These yere people's headin'
      for some'ers down on the Rio Grande, aimin' to settle a whole lot. Mebby
      it's the third mornin' along of sun-up when they strings out on the trail,
      an' we-alls thinks no more of 'em. It's gettin' about third-drink time
      when back rides a gent, sorter fretful like, an' allows he's done shy a
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When do you-all see this yere infant last?' says Mace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why,' says the gent, 'I shorely has him yesterday, 'cause my old woman
      done rounds 'em up an' counts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What time is that yesterday?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bout first-drink time,' says the bereaved party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How many of these yere offsprings, corral count, do you-all lay claim to
      anyway?' asks Mace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I've got my brand onto 'leven of 'em,' says the pore parent,
      beginnin' to sob a whole lot. 'Of course this yere young-one gettin'
      strayed this a-way leaves me short one. It makes it a mighty rough
      crossin', stranger, after bringin' that boy so far. The old woman, she
      bogs right down when she knows, an' I don't reckon she'll be the same
      he'pmeet to me onless I finds him ag'in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, well,' says Mace, tryin' to cheer this bereft person up, 'we lose
      kyards in the shuffle which the same turns up all right in the deal; an' I
      reckons we-alls walks down this yearlin' of yours ag'in, too. What for
      brands or y'earmarks, does he show, so I'll know him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As to brands an' y'earmarks,' says the party, a-wipin' of his eye, 'he's
      shy a couple of teeth, bein' milk-teeth as he's shed; an' thar's a mark on
      his for'ard where his mother swipes him with a dipper, that a-way,
      bringin' him up proper. That's all I remembers quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mace tells the party to take a cinch on his feelin's, an' stampedes over
      to the Mexican part of camp, which is called Chilili, on a scout for the
      boy. Whatever do you-all reckon's become of him, son? I'm a wolf if a
      Mexican ain't somehow cut him out of the herd an' stole him. Takes him in,
      same as you mavericks a calf. Why in the name of hoss-stealin' he ever
      yearns for that young-one is allers too many for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the abductor hears how Mace is on his trail, which he does from
      other Mexicans, he swings onto his bronco an' begins p'intin' out, takin'
      boy an' all. But Mace has got too far up on him, an' stops him mighty
      handy with a rifle. Mace could work a Winchester like you'd whirl a rope,
      an' the way he gets a bullet onder that black-an'-tan's left wing don't
      worry him a little bit. The bullet tears a hole through his lungs, an' the
      same bein' no further use for him to breathe with, he comes tumblin' like
      a shot pigeon, bringin' the party's offspring with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which this yere is almighty flatterin' to Mace as a shot, an' it plumb
      tickles the boy's sire. He allows he's lived in Arkansaw, an' shorely
      knows good shootin', an' this yere's speshul good. An' then he corrals the
      Greaser's skelp to take back with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It'll come handy to humor up the old woman with, when I gets back to
      camp,' he says; so he tucks the skelp into his war-bags an' thanks Mace
      for the interest he takes in his household.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's all right,' says Mace; 'no trouble to curry a little short hoss
      like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shakes hands with the Arkansaw gent, an' we-alls rounds up to Bob
      Step's an' gets a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the cat has quite a tail jest the same. A Mexican that a-way is
      plenty oncertain. For instance: You're settin' in on a little game of
      monte all free an' sociable, an' one of 'em comes crowdin' 'round for
      trouble, an' you downs him. All good enough, says you. No other Mexican
      seems like he wants to assoome no pressure personal; no one goes browsin'
      'round to no sheriff; an' thar you be deluded into theeries that said
      killin's quit bein' a question. That's where you- all is the victim of
      error.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which in this case the Mexican Mace stretches has uncles or somethin'
      down off Chaperita. Them relatives is rich. In a week&mdash;no one never
      saveys how&mdash;everybody knows that thar's five thousand dollars up for
      the first party who kills Mace. I speaks to him about it myse'f, allowin'
      he'd oughter be careful how he goes spraddlin' about permiscus. Mebby,
      when he's lookin' north some time, somebody gets him from the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I ain't worryin' none,' says Mace; 'I ain't got no friends as would down
      me, nohow; an' my enemies ain't likely none to think it's enough dinero.
      Killin' me is liable to come mighty high.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "After which announcements he goes romancin' along in his cheerful,
      light-hearted way, drinkin' his whiskey an' bein' sheriff, mingled, an' in
      a week or so we-alls begins to forget about them rewards. One day a little
      Mexican girl who Mace calls Bonita&mdash;she'd shorely give a hoss for a
      smile from him any time&mdash;scouts over an' whispers to Mace as how
      three Greasers from down around Anton Chico is in camp on a hunt for his
      ha'r. Them murderers is out for the five thousand; they's over in Chilili
      right then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whereabouts in Chilili be them Mexicans?' asks Mace, kinder interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Over camped in old Santa Anna's dance. hall, a-drinkin' of mescal an'
      waitin' for dark,' says the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'All right,' says Mace; 'I'll prance over poco tiempo, an' it's mighty
      likely them aliens from Anton Chico is goin' to have a fitful time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mace kisses the little Bonita girl, an' tells her not to chirp nothin' to
      no Mexican; an' with the caress that a-way her black eyes gets blacker an'
      brighter, an' the red comes in her cheek, an' bats could see she'd swap
      the whole Mexican outfit for a word from Mace, an' throw herse'f in for
      laniyap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mace p'ints out to get another gun; which is proper enough, for he's only
      one in his belt, an' in a case like this yere he's mighty likely to need
      two a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Some of us oughter go over with Mace, I reckons,' says a party named
      Benson, sorter general to the crowd. 'What do you-alls think yourse'fs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Go nothin'!' retorts a gent who's called Driscoll, an' who's up to the
      hocks into a game of poker, an' don't like to see it break up an' him
      behind. 'The hand Mace holds don't need no he'p. If Mace is out after two
      or three of the boys now, it would be plenty different; but whoever hears
      of a white man's wantin' he'p that a- way to down three Greasers, an' him
      to open the game? Mace could bring back all the skelps in Chilili if he's
      that f'rocious an' wants to, an' not half try.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "This seems to be the general idee, an', aside of some bets which is made,
      no one takes no interest. Bob Short puts it up he'd bet a hundred dollars
      even Mace gets one of 'em; a hundred to two hundred he gets two, an' a
      hundred to five hundred he gets 'em all; an' some short-kyard sharp who's
      up from Socorro, after figgerin' it all silent to himse'f, takes 'em all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now I don't reckon, stranger,' says Benson, sorter reproachful, to the
      short-kyard party, 'you knows Mace Bowman mighty well? If you- all did you
      wouldn't go up ag'in a shore thing like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never gets anythin' but Mace's story for it. He tells later how he
      sa'nters into Santa Anna's an' finds his three Anton Chico felons all
      settin' alone at a table. They knows him, he says, an' he camps down over
      opp'site an' calls for a drink. They's watchin' Mace, an' him doin'
      sim'lar by them. Final, he says, one of 'em makes a play for his gun, an',
      seein' thar's nothin' to be made waitin', Mace jumps up with a six-shooter
      in each hand, an' thar's some noise an' a heap of smoke, an' them three
      Mexicans is eliminated in a bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he plays his hand out Mace comes back over to us&mdash;no other
      Mexicans allowin' for to call him&mdash;an' relates how it is, an'
      nacheral we says it's all right, which it shorely is. I asks old Santa
      Anna for the details of the shake-up later, but he spreads his hands, an'
      shrugs his shoulders, an' whines
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No quien sabe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An', of course, as I can't tell, an' as Santa Anna don't, I gives' up
      askin'."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A WOLFVILLE THANKSGIVING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in the earlier days of autumn. Summer had gone, and there was
      already a crisp sentiment of coming cold in the air. The Old Cattleman and
      I had given way to a taste for pedestrianism that had lain dormant through
      the hot months. It was at the close of our walk, and we were slowly making
      our way homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' now the year's got into what hoss-folks calls the last quarter,"
      remarked the old gentleman musingly. "You can feel the frost in the
      atmosphere; you can see where it's bit the leaves a lot, an' some of 'em's
      pale with the pain, an' others is blood-red from the wound. "Which I don't
      regard winter much, say twenty years ago. Thar's many a night when I
      spreads my blankets in the Colorado hills, flakes of snow a-fallin' as
      soft an' big an' white as a woman's hand, an' never heeds 'em a little
      bit. But them days is gone. Thar's no roof needed in my destinies then.
      An' as for bed, a slicker an' a pair of hobbles is sumptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When a gent rounds up seventy years he's mighty likely to get a heap
      interested in weather. It's the heel of the hunt with him then, an' he's
      worn an' tired, and turns nacherally to rest an' fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      We plodded forward as he talked. To his sage comments on the seasons, and
      as well the old age of men, I offered nothing. My silence, however, seemed
      always to meet with his tacit approval; nor did he allow it to impede his
      conversational flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," observed the old fellow, after a pause, "I reckons I'll see the
      winter through all right; likewise the fall. I'm a mighty sight like that
      old longhorn who allows he's allers noticed if he lives through the month
      of March he lives through the rest of the year; so I figgers I'll hold
      together that a-way ontil shorely March comin'. Anyhow I regards it as an
      even break I does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's one thing about fall an' winter which removes the dreariness some.
      I alloods to them festivals sech as Thanksgivin' an' Christmas an' New
      Year. Do we-alls cel'brate these yere events in Wolfville? Which we
      shorely does. Take Christmas: You-all couldn't find a sober gent in
      Wolfville on that holy occasion with a search-warrant; the feelin' to
      cel'brate is that wide-spread an' fervid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanksgivin' ain't so much lotted on; which for one thing we frequent
      forgets it arrives that a-way. Thar's once, though, when we takes note of
      its approach, an' nacherally, bein' organized, we ketches it squar' in the
      door. Them Thanksgivin' doin's is shorely great festivities that time.
      It's certainly a whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Man Enright makes the first break; he sorter arranges the game. But
      before all is over, the food we eats, the whiskey we drinks, an' the lies
      we tells an' listens to, is a shock an' a shame to Arizona.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's a passel of us prowlin' 'round in the Red Light one day, when
      along comes Enright. He's got a paper in his hand, an' from the air he
      assooms it's shore plain he's on the brink of somethin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What I'm thinkin' of, gents, is this,' says Enright, final. 'I observes
      to-morrow to be Thanksgivin' by this yere paper Old Monte packs in from
      Tucson. The Great Father sets to-morrow for a national blow-out, a-puttin'
      of it in his message on the broad ground that everybody's lucky who
      escapes death. Now, the question is, be we in this? an' if so, what form
      the saturnalia takes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      What's the matter of us hoppin' over an' shootin' up Red Dog?" says Dan
      Boggs. 'That bunch of tarrapins ain't been shook up none for three
      months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Technical speakin',' says Doc Peets&mdash;which Peets, he shorely is the
      longest-headed sharp I ever sees, an' the galiest&mdash;'shootin' up Red
      Dog, while it's all right as a prop'sition an' highly creditable to Boggs,
      is not a Thanksgivin' play. The game, turned strict, confines itse'f to
      eatin', drinkin', an' lyin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's plenty of whiskey in camp,' says Jack Moore, meditative- like,
      'whereby that drinkin' part comes easy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I assooms it's the will of all to pull off a proper Thanksgivin' caper,'
      says Enright, 'an' tharfore I su'gests that Doc Peets and Boggs waits on
      Missis Rucker at the O. K. restauraw an' learns what for a banquet she can
      rustle an' go the limit. Pendin' the return of Peets an' Boggs I allows
      the balance of this devoted band better imbibe some. Barkeep, sort out
      some bottles.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The committee comes back after a little, an' allows Missis Rucker reports
      herse'f shy on viands on account of the freighters bein' back'ard comin'
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But,' says Peets, 'she's upholstered to make a strong play on salt hoss
      an' baked beans, with coffee an' biscuits for games on the side.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's good enough for a dog,' says Jack Moore, 'to say nothin' of mere
      people. Any gent who thinks he wants more is the effect victim of whims.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "While we-alls is discussin' the ground plans for this yere feast, thar's
      a clatter of pony-hoofs an' a wild yell outside, an' next thar's a big,
      shaggy-lookin' vagrant, a-settin' on his hoss in front of the Red Light's
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Get an axe, somebody,' he shouts, 'an' widen this yere portal some. I
      aims to come in on my hoss.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`Hands up, thar!' says Jack Moore, reachin' for his six-shooter. 'Hands
      up! I'll jest fool you up about comin' in on your hoss. You work in one
      wink too many now, an' I puts a hole in your face right over the eye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Go slow, Jack,' says Enright. 'Who may you-all be?' he goes on to the
      locoed man on the hoss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Me?' says the locoed man. 'I'm Red Dog Bill. Tell that sot,' he
      continues, p'intin' at Jack, ' to put down his gun an' not offer it at me
      no more. He's a heap too vivid with that weepon. Only I'm a white-winged
      harbinger of peace, I shore ups an' makes him eat the muzzle offen it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, whatever be you thirstin' for, anyhow?' says Enright. 'You comes
      ridin' in yere like you ain't got no regards for nothin'. Is this a
      friendly call, or be you present on a theery that you runs the town?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm the Red Dog committee on invitations,' he says. 'Red Dog sends its
      comps, an' asks Wolfville to bury the hatchet for one day in honor of
      to-morrow bein' Thanksgivin', an' come feed with us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Let's go him,' says Dan Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now stand your hand a second,' says Enright, 'don't let's overlook no
      bets. Whatever has you Red Dog hold-ups got to eat, anyhow?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ain't got nothin' to eat much&mdash;maybe some can stuff&mdash;what
      you-alls calls air-tights,' says the Red Dog man. 'But we has liquid, no
      limit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Got any can tomatters?' says Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Can tomatters we-alls is 'speshul strong on,' says the Red Dog man.
      'It's where we-alls lives at; can tomatters is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I tells you what you-all do,' says Enright, 'an' when I speaks, I
      represents for this yere camp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which he shore does,' says Jack. 'He's the Big Gray Wolf yere, you can
      gamble. If he don't say "go slow" when you comes a-yellin' up, your
      remains would a-been coverin' half an acre right now. It would look like
      it's beef-day at this yere agency, shore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You-all go back to Red Dog,' says Enright, payin' no notice to Jack's
      interruptions, 'an' tell 'em we plants the war-axe for one day, an' to
      come over an' smoke ponies with us, instead of we-alls come thar. We're
      goin' to have baked beans an' salt hoss, an' we looks for Red Dog in a
      body. Next Thanksgivin' we eats in Red Dog. Does this yere go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "`It goes,' says the Red Dog gent; 'but be you-alls shore thar's
      s'fficient whiskey in your camp? Red Dog folks is a dry an' burnin' outfit
      an' is due to need a heap.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The liquid's all right,' says Boggs. 'If you alls wants to do yourse'f
      proud, freight in a hundred-weight of them can tomatters. Which we runs
      out entire.'
    </p>

      The next day Missis Rucker sets tables all over her dinin'-room an' brings
      on her beans. Eighteen Red Dog gents is thar, each totin' of a can of
      tomatters. An' let me impart right yere, son, we never has a more free an'
      peacefuller day than said Thanksgivin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them beans is a little hard, ain't they?' says Doc Peets, while we-alls
      is eatin', bein' p'lite an' elegant like. 'Mebby they don't get b'iled
      s'fficient?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them beans is all right,' says the War Chief of the Red Dogs. 'They be
      some hard, but you can't he'p it none. It's the altitood; the higher up
      you gets, the lower heat it takes to b'ile water. So it don't mush up
      beans like it should.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's c'rrect every time,' says Enright; 'I mind bein' over back of
      Prescott once, an' up near timber-line, an' I can't b'ile no beans at all.
      I'm up that high the water is so cold when it b'iles that ice forms on it
      some. I b'iles an' b'iles on some beans four days, an' it don't have no
      more effect than throwin' water on a drowned rat. After persistent
      b'ilin', I skims out a hand. ful an' drops 'em onto a tin plate to test
      'em, an' it sounds like buckshot. As you says, it's the altitood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gents,' says the boss of Red Dog, all of a sudden, an' standin' up by
      Enright, 'I offers the toast: "Wolfville an' Red Dog, now an' yereafter."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course we-alls drinks, an' Doc Peets makes a talk. He speaks mighty
      high of every gent present; which compliments gets big action in sech a
      game. The Red Dog chief&mdash;an' he's a mighty civilized- lookin' gent&mdash;he
      talks back, an' calls Wolfville an' Red Dog great commercial centers,
      which they sore be. He says, 'We-alls is friendly to-day, an' fights the
      rest of the year,' which we-alls agrees to cordial. He says fightin'. or,
      as he calls it, 'a generous rivalry,' does camps good, an' I reckons he's
      right, too, 'cause it shore results in the cashin' in of some mighty bad
      an' disturbin' elements. When he sets down, thar's thunders of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's by this time that the drinkin' becomes frequent an' common. The talk
      gets general, an' the lies them people evolves an' saws off on each other
      would stampede stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any day but Thanksgivin' sech tales would shore lead to reecriminations
      an' blood; but as it is, every gent seems relaxed an' onbuckled that a-way
      in honor of the hour, an' it looks like lyin' is expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How mendacious be them people? If I recalls them scenes c'rrectly, it's
      Texas Thompson begins the campaign ag'in trooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere Texas Thompson tells, all careless-like, how 'way back in the
      forties, when he's a boy, he puts in a Thanksgivin' in the Great Salt Lake
      valley with Old Jim Bridger. This is before the Mormons opens their little
      game thar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' the snow falls to that extent, mebby it's six foot deep,' says
      Texas. 'Bridger an' me makes snow-shoes an' goes slidin' an' pesterin'
      'round all fine enough. But the pore animals in the valley gets a rough
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's a fact; Bridger an' me finds a drove of buffalos bogged down in the
      snow,&mdash;I reckons now thar's twenty thousand of 'em,&mdash;and never a
      buffalo can move a wheel or turn a kyard. Thar they be planted in the
      snow, an' only can jest wag their y'ears an' bat their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, to cut it brief, Bridger an' me goes projectin' 'round an' cuts
      the throats of them twenty-thousand buffalo; which we-alls is out for them
      robes a whole lot. Of course we don't skin 'em none while they's stuck in
      the snow; but when the snow melts in the spring, we capers forth an' peels
      off the hides like shuckin' peas. They's froze stiff at the time, for the
      sun ain't got 'round to thaw the beef none yet; an' so the meat's as good
      as the day we downs 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' that brings us to the cur'ous part. As fast as we-alls peels a
      buffalo, we rolls his carcass down hill into Salt Lake, an' what do
      you-alls reckons takes place? The water's that briny, it pickles said
      buffalo-meat plumb through, an' every year after, when Bridger an' me is
      back thar&mdash;we're trappin' an' huntin' them times,&mdash;all we has to
      do is haul one of them twenty thousand pickled buffalos ashore an' eat
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When the Mormons comes wanderin' along, bein' short on grub that a-way,
      they nacherally jumps in an' consooms up the whole outfit in one season,
      which is why you-alls don't find pickled buffalo in Salt Lake no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bridger an' me starts in, when we learns about it, to fuss with them
      polygamists that a-way for gettin' away with our salt buffalos. But they's
      too noomerous for us, an' we done quits 'em at last an' lets it go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody says much when Texas Thompson is through. We merely sets 'round
      an' drinks. But I sees the Red Dog folks feels mortified. After a minute
      they calls on their leadin' prevaricator for a yarn. His name's Lyin' Jim
      Riley, which the people who baptizes him shorely tumbles to his talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This yere Lyin' Jim fills a tin cup with nose-paint, an' leans back
      listless-like an' looks at Enright.

      "'I never tells you-alls,' he says, 'about how the Ratons gets afire
      mighty pecooliar, an' comes near a-roastin' of me up some, do I? It's this
      a-way: I'm pervadin' 'round one afternoon tryin' to compass a wild turkey,
      which thar's bands of 'em that Fall in the Ratons a-eatin' of the
      pinyon-nuts. I've got a Sharp's with me, which the same, as you-alls
      knows, is a single-shot, but I don't see no turks, none whatever. Now an'
      then I hears some little old gobbler, 'cross a canyon, a-makin' of
      sland'rous remarks about other gobblers to some hen he's deloodin', but I
      never manages a shot. As I'm comin' back to camp&mdash;I'm strollin' down
      a draw at the time where thar's no trees nor nothin'&mdash;thar emanates a
      black-tail buck from over among the bushes on the hill, an' starts to
      headin' my way a whole lot. His horns is jest gettin' over bein' velvet,
      an' he's feelin' plenty good an' sassy. I sees that buck&mdash;his horns
      eetches is what makes him&mdash;jump eighteen feet into the air an' comb
      them antlers of his'n through the hangin' pine limbs. Does it to stop the
      eetchin' an' rub the velvet off. Of course I cuts down on him with the
      Sharp's. It's a new gun that a-way, an' the sights is too coarse&mdash;you
      drags a dog through the hind sights easy&mdash;an' I holds high. The
      bullet goes plumb through the base of his horn, close into the ha'r, an'
      all nacheral fetches him sprawlin'. I ain't waitin' to load my gun none,
      which not waitin' to load, I'm yere to mention, is erroneous. I'm yere to
      say thar oughter be an act of Congress ag'in not loadin' your gun. They
      oughter teach it to the yearlin's in the schools, an' likewise in the
      class on the Sabbath. Allers load your gun. Who is that sharp, Mister
      Peets, who says, "Be shore you're right, then go ahead"? He once ranches
      some'ers down on the Glorieta. But what he oughter say is: "Be shore your
      gun's loaded, then go ahead."'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's whatever!' says Dan Boggs, he'pin' himse'f an' startin' the
      bottle; 'an' if he has a lick of sense, that's what he would say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I lays down my empty gun,' goes on this Lyin' Jim, ' an' starts
      for my buck to bootcher his neck a lot. When I gets within ten feet he
      springs to his hoofs an' stands glarin'. You can gamble, I ain't tamperin'
      'round no wounded buck. I'd sooner go pesterin' 'round a widow woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I gets mingled up with a wounded buck once,' says Dave Tutt, takin' a
      dab of paint, 'an' I nacherally wrastles him down an' lops one of his
      front laigs over his antlers, an' thar I has him; no more harm left in him
      than a chamber-maid. Mine's a white-tailed deer over on the Careese.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere's a black-tail, which is different; says Lyin' Jim; 'it's
      exactly them front laigs you talks of so lightly I'm 'fraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "`The buck he stands thar sorter dazed an' battin' of his eyes. I ain't no
      time to go back for my Sharp's, an' my six-shooter is left in camp. Right
      near is a high rock with a steep face about fifteen feet straight up an'
      down. I scrambles on to this an' breathes ag'in, 'cause I knows no deer is
      ever compiled yet who makes the trip. The buck's come to complete by now,
      an' when he observes me on the rock, his rage is as boundless as the glory
      of Texas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gents, we-alls takes another cow-swaller, right yere,' shouts Texas
      Thompson. 'It's a rool with me to drink every time I hears the sacred name
      of Texas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we-alls conceals our forty drops in the usual place, Lyin' Jim
      proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'When this buck notes me, he's that frenzied he backs off an' jumps ag'in
      the face of the rock stiff-laiged, an' strikes it with them hoofs of him.
      Which he does this noomerous times, an' every hoof cuts like a
      cold-chisel. It makes the sparks go spittin' an' flyin' like it's a
      blacksmith-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm takin' it ca'm enough, only I'm wonderin' how I'm goin' to fetch
      loose, when I notices them sparks from his hoofs sets the pine twigs an'
      needles a-blazin' down by the base of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's what comes to my relief. In two minutes this yere spreads to a
      general conflagration, and the last I sees of my deer he's flyin' over the
      Divide into the next canyon with his tail a-blazin' an' him utterin'
      shrieks. I has only time to make camp, saddle up, an' line out of thar, to
      keep from bein' burned before my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere fire rages for two months, an' burns up a billion dollars
      worth of mountains, I'm a coyote if some folks don't talk of lawin' me
      about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's a yarn which has the year-marks of trooth, but all the same it's
      deer as saves my life once,' says Doc Peets, sorter trailin' in
      innocent-like when this Lyin' Jim gets through; 'leastwise their meat
      saves it. I'm out huntin' same as you is, this time to which I alloods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm camped on upper Red River; up where the river is only about twelve
      feet wide. It ain't deep none, only a few inches, but it's dug its banks
      down about four feet. The river runs along the center of a mile-wide
      valley, which they ain't no trees in it, but all cl'ar an' open. It's
      snowin' powerful hard one, evenin' about 3 o'clock when I comes back along
      the ridge towards my camp onder the pines. While I'm ridin' along I
      crosses the trail of nineteen deer. I takes it too quick, 'cause I needs
      deer in my business, an' I knows these is close or their tracks would be
      covered, the way it snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I runs the trail out into the open, headin' for the other ridge. The
      snow is plenty deep out from onder the pines, but I keeps on. Final, jest
      in the mouth of a canyon, over the other side where the pines begins
      ag'in, up jumps a black. tail from behind a yaller-pine log, and I drops
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My pony's plumb broke down by now, so I makes up my mind to camp. It's a
      'way good site. Thar's water comin' down the canyon; thar's a big, flat
      floor of rocks&mdash;big as the dance-hall floor&mdash;an' all protected
      by a high rock-faced bluff, so no snow don't get thar none; an' out in
      front, some twelve feet, is a big pitch-pine log. Which I couldn't a-fixed
      things better if I works a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I sets fire to the log, cuts up my deer, an' sorter camps over between
      the log an' bluff, an' takes things as ba'my as summer. I has my
      saddle-blanket an' a slicker, an' that's all I needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar ain't no grass none for the little hoss, but I peels him about a
      bushel of quakin'-ash bark, an' he's doin' well 'nough. Lord! how it snows
      outside! When I peers out in the mornin' it scares me. I saddles up,
      'cause my proper camp is in the pines t'other side of this yere open
      stretch, an' I've got to make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My pony is weak, an' can only push through the snow, which is five feet
      deep. I'm walkin' along all comfortable, a-holdin' of his tail, when
      "swish" he goes plumb outen sight. I peers into the orifice which ketches
      him, an' finds he's done slumped off that four-foot bank into Red River,
      kerslop! Which he's at once swept from view; the river runnin' in ondcr
      the snow like a tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That settles it; I goes pirootin' back. I lives in that canyon two
      months. It snows a heap after I gets back, an' makes things deeper'n ever.
      I has my deer to eat, not loadin' my pony with it when I starts, an' I
      peels some sugar-pines, like I sees Injuns, an' scrapes off the white skin
      next the trees, an' makes a pasty kind of bread of it, an' I'm all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'One mornin', jest before I gets out of meat, I sees trouble out in the
      snow. Them eighteen deer&mdash;thar's nineteen, but I c'llects one, as I
      says&mdash;comes sa'nterin' down my canyon while I'm asleep, an' goes out
      an' gets stuck in the snow. I allows mebby they dresses about sixty pounds
      each, an' wallers after 'em with my knife an' kills six.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere gives me meat for seventy-two days&mdash;five pounds a day,
      which with the pine bark is shore enough, The other twelve I turns 'round
      an' he'ps out into the canyon ag'in, an' do you know, them deer's that
      grateful they won't leave none? It's a fact, they simply hangs 'round all
      the time I'm snowed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'In two months the snow melts down, an' I says adios to my twelve deer
      an' starts for camp. Which you-alls mebby imagines my s'prise when I
      beholds my pony a-grazin' out in the open, saddle on an' right. Yere's how
      it is: He's been paradin' up an' down the bed of Red River onder that snow
      tunnel for two months. Oh! he feeds easy enough. Jest bites the yerbage
      along the banks. This snow tunnel is four feet high, an' he's got plenty
      of room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'm some glad to meet up with my pony that a-way, you bet! an' ketches
      him up an' rides over to my camp. An' I'm followed by my twelve deer,
      which comes cavortin' along all genial an' cordial an' never leaves me.
      No, my hoss is sound, only his feet is a little water-soaked an' tender;
      an' his eyes, bein' so long in that half. dark place onder the snow, is
      some weak an' sore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "As no one seems desirous to lie no more after Doc Peets gets through,
      we-alls eats an' drinks all we can, an' then goes over to the dance-hall
      an' whoops her up in honor of Red Dog. Nothin' could go smoother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it comes time to quit, we has a little trouble gettin' sep'rate from
      'em, but not much. We-alls starts out to 'scort 'em to Red Dog as a guard
      of honor, an' then they, bustin' with p'liteness, 'scorts us back to
      Wolfville. Then we-alls, not to be raised out, sees 'em to Red Dog ag'in,
      an' not to have the odd hoss onto 'em in the matter, back they comes with
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know how often we makes this yere round trip from one camp to
      t'other, cause my mem'ry is some dark on the later events of that
      Thanksgivin'. My pony gets tired of it about the third time back, an'
      humps himse'f an' bucks me off a whole lot, whereupon I don't go with them
      Red Dog folks no further, but nacherally camps down back of the mesquite I
      lights into, an, sleeps till mornin'. You bet! it's a great Thanksgivin'.'

    <h3>
      BILL HOSKINS'S COON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Now I thoroughly saveys," remarked the Old Cattleman reflectively, at a
      crisis in our conversation when the talk turned on men of small and
      cowardly measure, "I thoroughly saveys that taste for battle that lurks in
      the deefiles of folk's nacher like a wolf in the hills Which I reckons now
      that I, myse'f, is one of the peacefullest people as ever belts on a
      weepon; but in my instincts&mdash;while I never jestifies or follows his
      example&mdash;I cl'arly apprehends the emotions of a gent who convenes
      with another gent all sim'lar, an' expresses his views with his gun. Sech
      is human nacher onrestrained, an' the same, while deplorable, is not
      s'prisin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this yere Olson I has in my mem'ry don't have no sech manly feelin's
      as goes with a gun play. Olson is that cowardly he's even furtive; an' for
      a low-flung measly game let me tell you-all what Olson does. It's shorely
      ornery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It all arises years ago, back in Tennessee, an' gets its first start out
      of a hawg which is owned by Olson an' is downed by a gent named Hoskins&mdash;Bill
      Hoskins. It's this a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back in Tennessee in my dream-wreathed yooth, when livestock goes
      projectin' about permiscus, a party has to build his fences 'bull strong,
      hawg tight, an' hoss high,' or he takes results. Which Hoskins don't make
      his fences to conform to this yere rool none; leastwise they ain't hawg
      tight as is shown by one of Olson's hawgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hawg comes pirootin' about Hoskins's fence, an' he goes through easy;
      an' the way that invadin' animal turns Bill's potatoes bottom up don't
      hinder him a bit. He shorely loots Bill's lot; that's whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Bill, perceivin' of Olson's hawg layin' waste his crop, reaches down
      a 8-squar' rifle, 30 to the pound, an' stretches the hawg. Which this is
      where Bill falls into error. Layin' aside them deeficiencies in Bill's
      fence, it's cl'ar at a glance a hawg can't be held responsible. Hawgs is
      ignorant an' tharfore innocent; an' while hawgs can be what Doc Peets
      calls a' CASUS BELLI,' they can't be regarded as a foe legitimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what Bill oughter done, if he feels like this yore hawg's done put it
      all over him, is to go an' lay for Olson. Sech action by Bill would have
      been some excessive,&mdash;some high so to speak; but it would have been a
      line shot. Whereas killin' the hawg is 'way to one side of the mark; an'
      onder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, as I states, Bill bein' hasty that a-way, an' oncapable of
      perhaps refined reasonin', downs the pig, an' stands pat, waitin' for
      Olson to fill his hand, if he feels so moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's at this pinch where the cowardly nacher of this yere Olson begins to
      shine. He's ugly as a wolf about Bill copperin' his hawg that a-way, but
      he don't pack the nerve to go after Bill an' make a round-up of them
      grievances. An' he ain't allowin' to pass it up none onrevenged neither.
      Now yere's what Olson does; he 'sassinates Bill's pet raccoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, son, jest massacres a pore, confidin' raccoon, who don't no
      more stand in on that hawg-killin' of Bill's, than me an' you,&mdash;don't
      even advise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I shorely allows you saveys all thar is to know about a raccoon.
      No? Well, a raccoon's like this: In the first place he's plumb easy, an'
      ain't lookin' for no gent to hold out kyards or ring a cold deck on him.
      That's straight; a raccoon is simple-minded that a-way; an' his impressive
      trait is, he's meditative. Besides bein' nacherally thoughtful, a raccoon
      is a heap melancholy,&mdash;he jest sets thar an' absorbs melancholy from
      merely bein' alive.
    </p>

      "But if a raccoon is melancholy or gets wropped in thought that a- way,
      it's after all his own play. It's to his credit that once when he's tamed,
      he's got mountainous confidence in men, an' will curl up to sleep where
      you be an' shet both eyes. He's plumb trustful; an' moreover, no matter
      how mournful a raccoon feels, or how plumb melancholy he gets, he don't
      pester you with no yarns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckons I converses with this yere identical raccoon of Bill's plenty
      frequent; when he feels blue, an' ag'in when he's at his gailiest, an' he
      never remarks nothin' to me except p'lite general'ties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this yere Olson was a dead game party who regards himse'f wronged,
      he'd searched out a gun, or a knife, or mebby a club, an' pranced over an'
      rectified Bill a whole lot. But he's too timid an' too cowardly, an'
      afraid of Bill. So to play even, he lines out to bushwhack this he'pless,
      oninstructed raccoon. Olson figgers to take advantage of what's cl'arly a
      loop-hole in a raccoon's constitootion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mebby you never notices it about a raccoon, but once he gets interested
      in a pursoot, he's rigged so he can't quit none ontil the project's a
      success. Thar's herds an' bands of folks an' animals who's fixed sim'lar.
      They can start, an' they can't let up. Thar's bull-dogs: They begins a war
      too easy; but the c'pacity to quit is left out of bull-dogs entire. Same
      about nose-paint with gents I knows. They capers up to whiskey at the
      beginnin' like a kitten to warm milk; an' they never does cease no more.
      An' that's how the kyards falls to raccoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowin these yere deefects in raccoons, this Olson plots to take
      advantage tharof; an' by playin' it low on Bill's raccoon, get even with
      Bill about that dead hawg. Which Bill wouldn't have took a drove of hawgs;
      no indeed! not the whole Fall round-up of hawgs in all of West Tennessee,
      an' lose that raccoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's when Bill's over to Pine Knot layin' in tobacker, an' nose- paint
      an' corn meal, an' sech necessaries, when Olson stands in to down Bill's
      pet. He goes injunnin' over to Bill's an' finds the camp all deserted,
      except the raccoon's thar, settin', battin' his eyes mournful an' lonesome
      on the doorstep. This Olson camps down by the door an' fondles the
      raccoon, an' strokes his coat, an' lets him search his pockets with his
      black hands ontil he gets that friendly an' confident about Olson he'd
      told him anythin'. It's then this yere miscreant, Olson, springs his game.
      "H's got a couple of crawfish which he's fresh caught at the Branch. Now
      raccoons regards crawfish as onusual good eatin'. For myse'f, I can't say
      I deems none high of crawfish as viands, but raccoons is different; an'
      the way they looks at it, crawfish is pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Olson brings out his two crawfish an' fetchin' ajar of water from
      the spring, he drops in a crawfish an' incites an' aggravates Zekiel&mdash;that's
      the name of Bill's raccoon&mdash;to feel in an' get him a whole lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zekiel ain't none shy on the play. He knows crawfish like a gambler does
      a red chip; so turnin' his eyes up to the sky, like a raccoon does who's
      wropped in pleasant anticipations that a-way, he plunges in his paw an'
      gets it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once Zekiel acquires him, the pore crawfish don't last as long as
      two-bits at faro-bank. When Zekiel has him plumb devoured he turns his
      eyes on Olson, sorter thankful, an' 'waits developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Olson puts in the second crawfish, an' Zekiel takes him into camp same as
      t'other. It's now that Olson onfurls his plot on Zekiel. Olson drops a
      dozen buckshot into the jar of water. Nacherally, Zekiel, who's got his
      mind all framed up touchin' crawfish, goes after the buckshot with his
      fore foot. But it's different with buck- shot; Zekiel can't pick 'em up.
      He tries an' tries with his honest, simple face turned up to heaven, but
      he can't make it. All Zekiel can do is feel 'em with his foot, an' roll
      'em about on the bottom of the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now as I remarks prior, when a raccoon gets embarked that a-way, he can't
      quit. He ain't arranged so he can cease. Olson, who's plumb aware tharof,
      no sooner gets Zekiel started on them buckshot, than knowin' that nacher
      can be relied on to play her hand out, he sa'nters off to his wickeyup,
      leavin' Zekiel to his fate. Bill won't be home till Monday, an' Olson
      knows that before then, onless Zekiel is interrupted, he'll be even for
      that hawg Bill drops. As Olson cones to a place in the trail where he's
      goin' to lose sight of Bill's camp, he turns an' looks back. The picture
      is all his revenge can ask. Thar sets Zekiel on the doorstep, with his
      happy countenance turned up to the dome above, an' his right paw elbow
      deep in the jar, still rollin' an' feelin' them buckshot 'round, an'
      allowin' he's due to ketch a crawfish every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which it works out exactly as the wretched Olson figgers. The sun goes
      down, an' the Sunday sun comes up an' sets again; an' still pore Zekiel is
      planted by the jar, with his hopeful eyes on high, still feelin' of them
      buckshot. He can't quit no more'n if he's loser in a poker game; Zekiel
      can't. When Bill rides up to his door about second-drink time Monday
      afternoon, Olson is shorely even on that hawg. Thar lays Zekiel, dead.
      He's jest set thar with them buck-shot an' felt himse'f to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But speakin' of the sapiency of Bill Hoskins's Zekiel," continued the old
      gentleman as we lighted pipes and lapsed into desultory puffing, "while
      Zekiel for a raccoon is some deep, after all you-all is jest amazed at
      Zekiel 'cause I calls your attention to him a whole lot. If you was to go
      into camp with 'em, an' set down an' watch 'em, you'd shorely be s'prised
      to note how level-headed all animals be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now if thar's anythin' in Arizona for whose jedgement I don't have
      respect nacheral, it's birds. Arizona for sech folks as you an' me, an'
      coyotes an' jack-rabbits, is a good range. Sech as we-alls sorter fits
      into the general play an' gets action for our stacks. But whatever a bird
      can find entrancin' in some of them Southwestern deserts is allers too
      many for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I su'gests, I former holds fowls, who of free choice continues a
      residence in Arizona, as imbeciles. Yet now an' then I observes things
      that makes me oncertain if I'm onto a bird's system; an' if after all
      Arizona is sech a dead kyard for birds. It's possible a gent might be way
      off on birds an' the views they holds of life. He might watch the play an'
      esteem 'em loser, when from a bird's p'int of view they's makin' a
      killin', an' even callin' the turn every deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What he'ps to open my eyes a lot on birds is two Road Runners Doc Peets
      an' me meets up with one afternoon comin' down from Lordsburg. These yere
      Road Runners is a lanky kind of prop'sition, jest a shade off from spring
      chickens for size. Which their arrangements as to neck an' laigs is
      onrestricted an' liberal, an' their long suit is runnin' up an' down the
      sun-baked trails of Arizona with no object. Where he's partic'lar strong,
      this yere Road Runner, is in waitin' ontil some gent comes along, same as
      Doc Peets an' me that time, an' then attachin' of himse'f said cavalcade
      an' racin' along ahead. A Road Runner keeps up this exercise for miles,
      an' be about the length of a lariat ahead of your pony's nose all the
      time. When you- all lets out a link or two an' stiffens your pony with the
      spur, the Road Runner onbuckles sim'lar an' exults tharat. You ain't goin'
      to run up on him while he can wave a laig, you can gamble your last chip,
      an' you confers favors on him by sendin' your pony at him. Thar he stays,
      rackin' along ahead of you ontil satiated. Usual thar's two Road Run.
      ners, an' they clips it along side by side as if thar's somethin' in it
      for 'em; an' I reckons, rightly saveyed, thar is. However, the profits to
      Road Runners of them excursions ain't obvious, none whatever; so I won't
      try to set 'em forth. Them journeys they makes up an' down the trail
      shorely seems aimless to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But about Doc Peets an' me pullin' out from Lordsburg for Wolfville that
      evenin': Our ponies is puttin' the landscape behind 'em at a good
      road-gait when we notes a brace of them Road Runners with wings half
      lifted, pacin' to match our speed along the trail in front. As Road
      Runners is frequent with us, our minds don't bother with 'em none. Now an'
      then Doc an' me can see they converses as they goes speedin' along a level
      or down a slope. It's as if one says to t'other, somethin' like this yere
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How's your wind, Bill? Is it comin' easy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shore,' it would seem like Bill answers. 'Valves never is in sech shape.
      I'm on velvet; how's your laigs standin' the pace, Jim?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Laigs is workin' like they's new oiled,' Jim replies back; 'it's a plumb
      easy game. I reckons, Bill, me an' you could keep ahead of them mavericks
      a year if we-alls feels like it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bet a blue stack on it,' Bill answers. ' I deems these yere gents soft.
      Before I'd ride sech ponies as them, I'd go projectin' 'round some night
      an' steal one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them ponies is shorely a heap slothful,' Jim answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'At this mebby them Road Runners ruffles their feathers an' runs on
      swifter, jest to show what a slow racket keepin' ahead of me an' Peets is.
      An' these yere locoed birds keeps up sech conversations for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind I ain't sayin' that what I tells you is what them Road Runners
      really remarks; but I turns it over to you-all the way it strikes me an'
      Doc at the time. What I aims to relate, how-ever, is an incident as sheds
      light on how wise an' foxy Road Runners be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets an' me, as I states, ain't lavishin' no onreasonable notice on
      these yere birds, an' they've been scatterin' along the trail for mebby
      it's an hour, when one of 'em comes to a plumb halt, sharp. The other
      stops likewise an' rounds up ag'inst his mate; an' bein' cur'ous to note
      what's pesterin 'em, Peets an' me curbs to a stand-still. The Road Runner
      who stops first&mdash;the same bein' Bill&mdash; is lookin' sharp an'
      interested-like over across the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Rattlesnake,' he imparts to his side partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Where's he at?' says the side partner, which is Jim, 'where's this yere
      snake at, Bill? I don't note no rattlesnake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come round yere by me,' Bill says. 'Now on a line with the top of yonder
      mesa an' a leetle to the left of that soap-weed; don't you- all see him
      quiled up thar asleep?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I shorely does,' says Jim, locatin' the rattlesnake with his beady
      eye, 'an' he's some sunk in slumber. Bill, that serpent is our meat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Move your moccasins easy,' says Bill, 'so's not to turn him out. Let's
      rustle up some flat cactuses an' corral him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tharupon these yere Road Runners turns in mighty diligent; an' not makin'
      no more noise than shadows, they goes pokin' out on the plains ontil they
      finds a flat cactus which is dead; so they can tear off the leaves with
      their bills. Doc Peets an' me sets in our saddles surveyin' their play;
      an' the way them Road Runners goes about the labors of their snake killin'
      impresses us it ain't the first bootchery of the kind they appears in.
      They shorely don't need no soopervisin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One after the other, Jim an' Bill teeters up, all silent, with a flat
      cactus leaf in their beaks, an' starts to fence in the rattlesnake with
      'em. They builds a corral of cactus all about him, which the same is mebby
      six-foot across. Them engineerin' feats takes Jim an' Bill twenty minutes.
      But they completes 'em; an' thar's the rattlesnake, plumb surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These yere cactuses, as you most likely saveys, is thorny no limit; an'
      the spikes is that sharp, needles is futile to 'em. Jim an' Bill knows the
      rattlesnake can't cross this thorny corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He don't look it none, but from the way he plays his hand, I takes it a
      rattlesnake is sensitive an' easy hurt onder the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' it's plain to me an' Peets them Road Runners is aware of said
      weaknesses of rattlesnakes, an' is bankin' their play tharon. We- alls
      figgers, lookin' on, that Jim an' Bill aims to put the rattlesnake in
      prison; leave him captive that a-way in a cactus calaboose. But we don't
      size up Jim an' Bill accurate at all. Them two fowls is shorely profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sooner is the corral made, than Jim an' Bill, without a word of
      warnin', opens up a warjig 'round the outside; flappin' their pinions an'
      screechin' like squaws. Nacherally the rattlesnake wakes up. The sight of
      them two Road Runners, Jim an' Bill, cussin' an' swearin' at him, an'
      carryin' on that a-way scares him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's trooth to say Bill an' Jim certainly conducts themse'fs scand'lous.
      The epithets they heaps on that pore ignorant rattlesnake, the taunts they
      flings at him, would have done Apaches proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattlesnake buzzes an' quils up, an' onsheaths his fangs, an' makes
      bluffs to strike Bill an' Jim, but they only hops an' dances about,
      thinkin' up more ornery things to say. Every time the rattlesnake goes to
      crawl away&mdash;which he does frequent&mdash;he strikes the cactus thorns
      an' pulls back. By an' by he sees he's elected, an' he gets that enraged
      he swells up till he's big as two snakes; Bill an' Jim maintainin' their
      sass. Them Road Runners is abreast of the play every minute, you can see
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last comes the finish, an' matters gets dealt down to the turn. The
      rattlesnake suddenly crooks his neck, he's so plumb locoed with rage an'
      fear, an' socks his fangs into himse'f. That's the fact; bites himse'f,
      an' never lets up till he's dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It don't seem to astound Jim an' Bill none when the rattlesnake
      'sassinates himse'f that a-way, an' I reckons they has this yere sooicide
      in view. They keeps pesterin' an' projectin' about ontil the rattlesnake
      is plumb defunct, an' then they emits a whirlwind of new whoops, an' goes
      over to one side an' pulls off a skelp dance. Jim an' Bill is shorely
      cel'bratin' a vic'try.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the skelp dance is over, Bill an' Jim tiptoes over mighty quiet an'
      sedate, an' Jim takes their prey by the tail an' yanks it. After the
      rattlesnake's drug out straight, him an' Bill runs their eyes along him
      like they's sizin' him up. With this yere last, however, it's cl'ar the
      Road Runners regards the deal as closed. They sa'nters off down the trail,
      arm in arm like, conversin' in low tones so Peets an' me never does hear
      what they says. When they's in what they takes to be the c'rrect p'sition,
      they stops an' looks back at me an' Peets. Bill turns to Jim like he's
      sayin':
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's them two short-horns ag'in. I wonders if they ever aims to pull
      their freight, or do they reckon they'll pitch camp right yere?"'

      CHAPTER XXII. OLD SAM ENRIGHT'S "ROMANCE."
    </h2>
    <p>
      "It mebby is, that romances comes to pass on the range when I'm thar,"
      remarked the Old Cattleman, meditatively, "but if so be, I never notes
      'em. They shorely gets plumb by me in the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman had just thrown down a daily paper, and even as he spoke
      I read on the upturned page the glaring headline: "Romance in Real Life."
      His recent literature was the evident cause of his reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," continued the Old Cattleman, turning for comfort to his
      inevitable tobacco pipe, "of course, at sech epocks as some degraded sharp
      takes to dealin' double in a poker game, or the kyards begins to come two
      at a clatter at faro-bank, the proceedin's frequent takes on what you-all
      might call a hue of romance; an' I admits they was likely to get some
      hectic, myse'f. But as I states, for what you-all would brand as clean.
      strain romance, I ain't recallin' none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about those love affairs of your youth?" I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I don't deny," replied the old gentleman, between puffs, "that back
      in Tennessee, as I onfolds before, I has my flower- scented days. But I
      don't wed nothin', as you-all knows, an' even while I'm ridin' an' ropin'
      at them young female persons, thar's never no romance to it, onless it's
      in the fact that they all escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But speakin' of love-tangles, Old Man Enright once recounts a story;
      which the same shows how female fancy is rootless an' onstable that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Allers copper a female.' says Cherokee Hall, one day, when Texas
      Thompson is relatin' how his wife maltreats him, an' rounds up a divorce
      from him down at Laredo. 'Allers play 'em to lose. Nell, yere,' goes on
      Cherokee, as he runs his hand over the curls of Faro Nell, who's lookout
      for Cherokee, 'Nelly, yere, is the only one I ever meets who can be
      depended on to come winner every trip.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which females,' says Old Man Enright, who's settin' thar at the time, '
      an' partic'lar, young females, is a heap frivolous, nacheral. A rainbow
      will stampede most of 'em. For myse'f, I'd shorely prefer to try an' hold
      a bunch of five hundred ponies on a bad night, than ride herd on the heart
      of one lady. Between gent an' gent that a-way, I more'n half figger the
      'ffections of a female is migratory, same as buffaloes was before they was
      killed, an' sorter goes north like in the spring, an' south ag'in in the
      winter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'As for me; says Texas Thompson, who's moody touchin' them divorce plays
      his wife is makin', 'you-alls can gamble I passes all females up. No
      matter how strong I holds, it looks like on the showdowns they outlucks me
      every time. Wherefore I quits 'em cold, an' any gent who wants my chance
      with females can shorely have the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, I don't know!' remarks Doc Peets, gettin' in on what's a general
      play, 'I've been all through the herd, an' I must say I deems women good
      people every time; a heap finer folks than men, an' faithfuller.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which I don't deny females is fine folks,' says Texas, 'but what I'm
      allowin' is, they's fitful. They don't stay none. You-alls can hobble
      an'sideline'em both at night; an' when you rolls out in the mornin',
      they's gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you-all think, Nell?' says Doc Peets to Faro Nell, who's perched
      up on her stool by Cherokee's shoulder. 'What do you-all reckon now of
      Texas yere, a-malignin' of your sex? Why don't you p'int him to Dave Tutt
      an' Tucson Jennie? Which they gets married, an' thar they be, gettin'
      along as peaceful as two six-shooters on the same belt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I don't mind what Texas says, none,' replies Faro Nell. 'Texas is all
      right, an' on the square". I shouldn't wonder none if this yere Missis
      Thompson does saw it off on him some shabby, gettin' that sep'ration, an'
      I don't marvel at his remarks. But as long as Cherokee yere thinks I'm
      right, I don't let nobody's views pester me a little bit, so thar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It's what I says awhile back,' interrupts Enright. 'Texas Thompson's
      wife's motives mighty likely ain't invidious none. It's a heap probable if
      the trooth is known, that she ain't aimin' nothin' speshul at Texas; she
      only changes her mind. About the earliest event I remembers,' goes on
      Enright, 'is concernin' a woman who changes her mind. It's years ago when
      I'm a yearlin'. Our company is makin' a round-up at a camp called Warwhoop
      Crossin', in Tennessee, organizin' to embark in the Mexican war a whole
      lot, an' thin out the Greasers. No one ever does know why I, personal,
      declar's myse'f in on this yere imbroglio. I ain't bigger 'n a charge of
      powder, an' that limited as to laigs I has to clamber onto a log to mount
      my pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But as I'm tellin', we-alls comes together at Warwhoop to make the
      start. I reckons now thar's five hundred people thar. `'Which the
      occasion, an' the interest the public takes in the business, jest combs
      the region of folks for miles about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar's a heap of hand-shakin' an' well-wishin' goin' on; mothers an'
      sisters, an' sweethearts is kissin' us good-bye; an' while thar's some
      hilarity thar's more sobs. It's not, as I looks back'ard, what you-alls
      would call a gay affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'While all this yere love an' tears is flowin', thar's a gent&mdash;he's
      our Captain&mdash;who's settin' off alone in his saddle, an' ain't takin'
      no hand. Thar's no sweetheart, no mother, no sister for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No one about Warwhoop knows this yere party much; more'n his name is
      Bent. He's captain with the Gov'nor's commission, an' comes from 'way-off
      yonder some'ers. An' so he sets thar, grim an' solid in his saddle,
      lookin' vague-like off at where the trees meets the sky, while the rest of
      us is goin' about permiscus, finishin' up our kissin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"Ain't he got no sweetheart to wish goodbye to him?" asks a girl of me.
      "Ain't thar no one to kiss him for good luck as he rides away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere maiden's name is Sanders, an' it's a shore fact she's the
      prettiest young female to ever make a moccasin track in West Tennessee.
      I'd a-killed my pony an' gone afoot to bring sech a look into her eyes, as
      shines thar when she gazes at the Captain where he's silent an' sol'tary
      on his hoss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No," I replies, "he's a orphan, I reckons. He's plumb abandoned that
      a-way, an' so thar's nobody yere to kiss him, or shake his hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere pretty Sanders girl&mdash;an' I'm pausin' ag'in to state she's
      a human sunflower, that a-way&mdash;this Sanders beauty, I'm sayin', looks
      at this party by himse'f for a moment, an' then the big tears begins to
      well in her blue eyes. She blushes like a sunset, an' walks over to this
      yere lone gent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mister Captain," she says, raisin' her face to him like a rose, "I'm
      shore sorry you ain't got no sweetheart to say 'good-bye;' an' bein'
      you're lonesome, that a-way, I'll kiss you an' say adios myse'f."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Will you, my little lady?" says the lonesome Captain, as he swings from
      his saddle to the ground by her side; an' thar's sunshine in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I'll think of you every day for that,"he says, when he kisses her, "an'
      if I gets back when the war's done, I'll shorely look for you yere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The little Sanders girl&mdash;she is shorely as handsome as a ace full
      on kings&mdash;blushes a heap vivid at what she's done, an' looks warm an'
      tender. Which, while the play is some onusual an' out of line, everybody
      agrees it's all right; bein' that we-alls is goin' to a war, that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now yere,' goes on Enright, at the same time callin' for red-eye all
      'round, ' is what youalls agrees is a mighty romantic deal. Yere's a love
      affair gets launched.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does this yere lone-hand gent who gets kissed by the Sanders lady
      outlive the war?' asks Texas Thompson, who has braced up an' gets mighty
      vivacious listenin' to the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which he shorely outlives that conflict,' replies Enright. 'An' you can
      gamble he's in the thick of the stampede, too, every time. I will say for
      this yere Captain, that while I ain't with him plumb through, he's as game
      a sport as ever fought up hill. He's the sort which fights an goes for'ard
      to his man at the same time. Thar's no white feathers on that kind; they's
      game as badgers. An' bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which if he don't get downed none,' says Texas Thompson, 'an' hits
      Tennessee alive, I offers ten to one he leads this yere Sanders female to
      the altar.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which you'd lose, a whole lot,' says Enright, at the same time raisin'
      his whiskey glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's what I states when I trails out on this yere romance. Females is
      frivolous an' plumb light of fancy. This Captain party comes back to
      Warwhoop, say, it's two years an' a half later, an' what do you-alls
      reckon? That Sanders girl's been married mighty nigh two yzars, an' has an
      infant child as big as a b'ar cub, which is beginnin' to make a bluff at
      walkin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Now, on the squar', an' I'm as s'prised about it as you be&mdash;I'm
      more'n s'prised, I'm pained&mdash;I don't allow, lookin' over results an'
      recallin' the fact of that b'ar-cub infant child, that for all her
      blushin', an' all her tears, an' kissin' that Captain party good-by that
      a-way, that the Sanders girl cares a hoss-h'ar rope for him in a week. An'
      it all proves what I remarks, that while females ain't malev'lent
      malicious, an' don't do these yere things to pierce a gent with grief,
      their 'ffections is always honin' for the trail, an' is shorely prone to
      move camp. But, bless 'em! they can't he'p it none if their hearts be
      quicksands, an' I libates to 'em ag'in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whereat we-alls drinks with Enright; feelin' a heap sim'lar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever becomes of this yerc pore Captain party?' asks Faro Nell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, the fact about that Captain,' replies Enright, settin' down his
      glass, 'while the same is mere incident, an' don't have no direct bearin'
      on what I relates; the fact in his case is he's wedded already. Nacherally
      after sayin' "howdy!" to the little Sanders girl, an' applaudin' of her
      progeny&mdash;which it looks like he fully endorses that a-way&mdash;this
      yere Captain gent hits the trail for Nashville, where his wife's been
      keepin' camp an' waitin' for him all the time."'

      CHAPTER XXIII. PINON BILL'S BLUFF.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "This narrative is what you-all might call some widespread," said the Old
      Cattleman, as he beamed upon me, evidently in the best of humors. "It
      tells how Pinon Bill gets a hoss on Jack Moore; leaves the camp bogged up
      to the saddle-girths in doubt about who downs Burke; an' stakes the Deef
      Woman so she pulls her freight for the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pinon Bill is reckoned a hard game. He's only in Wolfville now an' then,
      an' ain't cuttin' no figger in public calc'lations more'n it's regarded as
      sagacious to pack your gun while Pinon Bill's about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he don't down no white men no one ever hears of, but thar's stories
      about how he smuggles freight an' plunder various from Mexico, an' drives
      off Mexican cattle, an' once in awhile stretches a Mexican himse'f who
      objects to them enterprises of Pinon Bill's; but thar's nothin' in sech
      tales to interest Americans, more'n to hear 'em an' comment on 'em as
      plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But while Pinon Bill never turns his talents to American, them liberties
      he takes with Greasers gives him a heap of bad repoote, as a mighty ornery
      an' oneasy person; an' most of us sorter keeps tab on him whenever he
      favors Wolfville with his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This time he collides with Jack Moore, an' so to speak, leaves the
      drinks on Jack, he's been trackin' 'round camp mebby it's six weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Likewise thar's an old longhorn they calls the 'Major'; he's been
      hangin' about for even longer yet. Don't go to figgerin' on no hostilities
      between this Pinon Bill an' the Major, for their trails never does cross
      once. Another thing' Pinon Bill ain't nacheraliy hostile neither; ain't
      what you-all calls trailin' trouble; whereas the Major's also a heap too
      drunk to give way to war, bein' tanked that a-way continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I don't reckon thar's the slightest doubt but the Major's a bigger
      sot than Old Monte, though the same is in dispoote; Cherokee Hall an'
      Boggs a-holdin' he is; an' Doc Peets an' Tutt playin' the other end;
      Enright an' Jack Moore, ondecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peets confides in me of an' concernin' the Major that thar's a time&mdash;an'
      no further up the trail than five years&mdash;when the Major is
      shore-'nough a Major; bein' quartermaster or some sech bluff in the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one day Uncle Sam comes along an' wants to cash in; an' thar this
      yere crazy-hoss Major is with ten times as many chips out as he's got
      bank-roll to meet, an' it all fatigues the gov'ment to that extent the
      Major's cashiered, an' told to vamos the army for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I allers allows it's whiskey an' kyards gets the Major's roll that time.
      Peets says he sees him 'way back once over some'ers near the Mohave Desert&mdash;Wingate,
      mebby&mdash;an' whiskey an' poker has the Major roped; one by the horns,
      the other by the hoofs; an' they jest throws him an' drug him, an' drug
      him an' throws him, alternate. The Major never shakes loose from the loops
      of them vices; none whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' that's mighty likely, jest as I says, how the Major finds himse'f
      cashiered an' afoot; an' nothin' but disgrace to get rid of an' whiskey to
      get, to fill the future with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it comes when I trails up on the Major he's a drunkard complete,
      hangin' 'round with a tin-horn an' a handful of dice, tryin' to get
      Mexicans or Chinamen to go ag'in 'em for any small thing they names.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's on account of this yere drunkard the Major that the Deef Woman comes
      stagin' it in with Old Monte one day. Got a papoose with her, the Deef
      Woman has, a boy comin' three, an' it's my firm belief, which this view is
      common an' frequent with all Wolfville, as how the Deef Woman's the
      Major's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ain't no cinch play that this female's deef, neither; which it's
      allers plain she hears the most feeblesome yelp of that infant, all the
      way from the dance-hall to the O. K. House, an' that means across the camp
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boggs puts it up she merely gives it out she's deef that a-way to cut off
      debate with the camp, an' decline all confidences goin' an' comin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar's no reason to say the Deef Woman's the Major's wife, more'n she
      tumbles into camp as onlooked for as Old Monte sober, an' it's easy to
      note she s'prises an' dismays the Major a lot, even drunk an' soaked with
      nose paint as he shorely is.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Deef Woman has a brief pow-wow with him alone over at the O. K.
      House, followin' of which the Major appears the whitiest an' the shakiest
      I ever beholds him&mdash;the last bein' some strong as a statement&mdash;an'
      after beggin' a drink at the Red Light, p'ints out afoot for Red Dog, an'
      is seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the Deef Woman says to the Major, or him to her; or what makes him
      hit the trail for Red Dog that a-way no one learns. The Deef Woman ain't
      seemin' to regard the Major's jumpin' the outfit as no loss, however.
      Wherein she's plenty accurate, for that Major shorely ain't worth ropin'
      to brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After he's gone&mdash;an' the Major's moccasin track ain't never seen in
      Wolfville no more, he's gone that good&mdash;the next we-alls hears of the
      deal, this yere Deef Woman's playin' the piano at the dance- hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets an' Enright, likewise the rest, don't like this none whatever,
      for she don't show dance-hall y'ear marks, an' ain't the dance-hall brand;
      but it looks like they's powerless to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peets tries to talk to her, but she blushes an' can't hear him; while
      Enright an' Missis Rucker&mdash;which the last bein' a female herse'f is
      rung in on the play&mdash;don't win out nothin' more. Looks like all the
      Deef Woman wants is to be let alone, while she makes a play the best she
      can for a home-stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pauses to mention, however, that durin' the week the Deef Woman turns
      her game at the piano&mdash;for she don't stay only a week as the play
      runs out&mdash;she comes mighty near killin' the dance-hall business. The
      fact is this were Deef Woman plays that remarkable sweet no one dances at
      all; jest nacherally sets'round hungerin' for them melodies, an' cadences
      to that extent they actooally overlooks drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right; an' you can gamble your deepest chip when folks begins to
      overlook drinks, an' a glass of whiskey lasts energetic people half an
      hour, they's shorely some rapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even the coyotes cashes in an' quits their howls whenever the Deef Woman
      drug her chair up to that piano an' throws loose. An' them coyotes
      afterward, when she turns up her box an' stops dealin', gets that bashful
      an' taciturn they ain't sayin' a word; but jest withholds all yells entire
      the rest of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But thar's no use talkin' hours about the Deef Woman's music. It only
      lasts a week; even if Wolfville does brag of it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's this a-way: It's while Pinon Bill is romancin' round the time I
      mentions, that we-alls rolls outen our blankets one mornin' an' picks up a
      party whose name's Burke. This yere Burke is shot in the back; plumb dead,
      an' is camped when we finds him all cold an' stiff out back of the New
      York store.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day before, Burke, who's a miner, diggin' an' projectin' 'round over
      in the Floridas, is in camp layin' in powder an' fuse a whole lot, with
      which he means to keep on shootin' up the he'pless bosoms of the hills
      like them locoed miner people does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At night he's drunk; an' while thar's gents as sees Burke as late, mebby
      it's two hours after the last walse at the dance-hall, thar's nobody who
      ups an' imparts how Burke gets plugged. All Wolfville knows is that at
      first-drink time in the mornin', thar this Burke is plumb petered that
      a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' the worst feature shorely is that the bullet goes in his back, which
      makes it murder plain. Thar ain't a moccasin track to he'p tell who drops
      this yere Burke. Nacrerally, everybody's deeply taken to know who does it;
      for if thar's a party in camp who's out to shoot when your back's turned,
      findin' of him an' hangin' him can't be too pop'lar an' needful as a play.
      But, as I remarks, we're baffled, an' up ag'inst it absoloote. No one has
      the least notion who gets this yere Burke. It's money as is the object of
      the murder, for Burke's war-bags don't disclose not a single centouse when
      the committee goes through 'em prior to the obsequies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's two days the camp is talkin' over who does this crime, when Texas
      Thompson begins to shed a beam of light. This last was onlooked for, an'
      tharfore all the more interestin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Texas Thompson is a jedge of whiskey sech as any gent might tie to. He's
      a middlin' shot with a Colt's .44 an' can protect himse'f at poker. But
      nobody ever reckons before that Texas can think. Which I even yet deems
      this partic'lar time a inspiration, in which event Texas Thompson don't
      have to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's over in the Red Light the second after. noon when Texas turns loose
      a whole lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Enright,' he says, 'I shore has a preemonition this yere Burke gets
      plugged by Pinon Bill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'How does the kyards run so as to deal s'picions on Pinon Bill?' says
      Enright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This a-way,' says Texas, some confident an' cl'ar; 'somebody downs
      Burke; that's dead certain. Burke don't put that hole in the middle of his
      back himse'f; no matter how much he reckons it improves him. Then, when
      it's someone else who is it? Now,' goes on Texas, as glib as wolves,
      'yere's how I argues: You-all don't do it; Peets don't do it; Boggs don't
      do it; thar's not one of us who does it. An' thar you be plumb down to
      Pinon Bill. In the very nacher of the deal, when no one else does it an'
      it's done, Pinon Bill's got to do it. I tells you as shore as my former
      wife at Laredo's writin' insultin' letters to me right now, this yere
      Pinon Bill's the party who shoots up that miner gent Burke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Texas Thompson says makes an impression; which it's about the first
      thoughtful remark he ever makes, an' tharfore we're prone to give it
      more'n usual attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We imbibes on it an' talks it up an' down, mebby it's half an hour; an'
      the more we drinks an' the harder we thinks, the cl'arer it keeps gettin'
      that mighty likely this yere Texas has struck the trail. At last Jack
      Moore, who's, as I often says, prompt an' vig'lant that a-way, lines out
      to hunt this yere Pinon Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whyever do they call him Pinon Bill? Nothin' much; only once he comes
      into camp drunk an' locoed; an' bein' in the dark an' him hawg-hungry, he
      b'iles a kettle of pinon-nuts, a-holdin' of 'em erroneous to be beans, an'
      as sech aimin' to get some food outen 'em a whole lot. He goes to sleep
      while he's pesterin' with 'em, an' when the others tumbles to his game in
      the mornin', he's branded as 'Pinon Bill' ever more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Jack hops out to round-up Pinon Bill, all he does is go into the
      street. The first thing he notes is this yere Pinon Bill's pony standin'
      saddled over by the O. K. House, like he plans to pull his freight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which that bronco standin' thar,' says Jack to Enright, 'makes it look
      like Texas calls the turn with them surmises.' An' it shorely does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This pony makes Jack's play plenty simple; all he does now is to sa'nter
      'round the pony casooal like an' lay for Pinon Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack's too well brought up to go surgin' into rooms lookin' for Pinon
      Bill, where Jack's eyes comin' in outen the sun that a-way, can't see for
      a minute nohow, an' where Pinon Bill has advantages. It's better to wait
      for him outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You-all saveys how it's done in the West. When a gent's needed you allers
      opens the game with a gun-play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hold up your hands!' says you, sorter indicatin' a whole lot at your
      prey with a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which, by the way, if he don't enter into the sperit of the thing prompt
      an' p'int his paws heavenward an' no delay, you-all mustn't fall into no
      abstractions an' forget to shoot some. When you observes to a fellow-bein'
      that a-way
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold up your hands!' you must be partic'lar an' see he does it. Which if
      you grows lax on this p'int he's mighty likely to put your light out right
      thar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' jest as Jack Moore tells me once when we're puttin' in some leesure
      hours an' whiskey mingled, you don't want to go too close to standup your
      gent. Over in the Gunnison country, Jack says, a marshal he knows gets
      inadvertent that a-way, an' thoughtless, an' goes up close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Throw up your hands' says this yere marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His tone shows he's ennuied; he has so many of these yere blazers to run;
      that's why he's careless, mebby. When the party throws up his hands, he is
      careful an knocks the marshal's gun one side with his left hand, bein'
      he's too close as I says, at the same time pullin' his own wherewith he
      then sends that marshal to the happy huntin' grounds in one motion. Before
      ever that Gunnison offishul gets it outen his head that that sport's
      holdin' up his hands, he's receivin' notice on high to hustle 'round an'
      find his harp an' stand in on the eternal chorus for all he's worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which the public,' says Jack Moore, the time he relates about this yere
      Gunnison marshal bein over-played that time, 'takes an' hangs the killer
      in a minute. An' he's shorely a bad man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does you-all want to pray?" says one of the gents who's stringin' of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No, Ed," he says that a-way, "prayin's a blind trail to my eyes an' I
      can't run it a inch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"What for a racket," says this yere Ed, "would it be to pick out a sport
      to pray for you a whole lot; sorter play your hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"That's all right," says this culprit. "Nominate your sharp an' tell him
      to wade in an' roll his game. I reckons it's a good hedge, an' a little
      prayin' mebby does me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tharupon the committee puts for'ard a gent who's a good talker; but not
      takin' an interest much, he makes a mighty weak orison, that a-way. Thar's
      nohody likes it, from the culprit, who's standin' thar with the lariat
      'round his neck, to the last gent who's come up. This party blunders
      along, mebby it's a minute, when the culprit, who's plumb disgusted,
      breaks in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'"That's a hell of a pra'r," he says, "an' I don't want no more of it in
      mine. Gimme a drink of whiskey, gents, an' swing me off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The committee, whose sympathies is all with this yere party who's to
      hang, calls down the gent a heap who's prayin', gives the other his forty
      drops, an' cinches him up some free of the ground; which the same bein'
      ample for strang'lation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But,' concloods Jack, 'while they hangs him all right an' proper, that
      don't put off the funeral of the marshal none, who gets careless an' goes
      too close.' An' you bet Jack's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But goin' back: As I remarks, Jack stands round loose an' indifferent
      with his eye on the pony of Pinon Bill's, which it looks now like this
      yere Bill is aware of Jack's little game. He comes out shore-'nough, but
      he's organized. He's got his gun in his hand; an' also he's packin' the
      Deef Woman's yearlin' in front of his breast an' face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack gives him the word, but Pinon Bill only laughs. Then Jack makes a
      bluff with his gun like he's goin' to shoot Pinon Bill, the infant, an'
      all involved tharin. This yere last move rattles Pinon Bill, an' he ups
      an' slams loose at Jack. But the baby's in his way as much mebby as it is
      in Jack's, an' he only grazes Jack's frame a whole lot, which amounts to
      some blood an' no deep harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Down his pony, Jack!' shouts Dave Tutt, jumpin' outen the Red Light like
      he aims to get in on the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this yere Pinon Bill shifts the cut on 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'If one of you-alls so much as cracks a cap,' he says, 'I blows the head
      offen this yere blessed child.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' tharupon he shoves his gun up agin that baby's left y'ear that a-way,
      so it shore curdles your blood. He does it as readily as if it's grown-up
      folks. It shore sends a chill through me; an' Dan Boggs is that 'fected he
      turns plumb sick. Boggs ain't eatin' a thing, leastwise nothin' but
      whiskey, for two days after he sees Pinon Bill do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's on the level,' says this Pinon Bill ag'in.&mdash;The first
      vestich of a gun-play I witnesses, or if any gent starts to follow me
      ontil I'm a mile away, I'll send this yearlin' scoutin' after Burke. An'
      you-alls hears me say it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar it is; a squar' case of stand-off. Thar ain't a gent who's game to
      make a move. Seein' we ain't got a kyard left to play, this yere Pinon
      Bill grins wide an' satisfactory, an' swings into the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this time&mdash;which, after all, it ain't so long&mdash;the baby
      ain't sayin' nothin', and takes the deal in plumb silence. But jest as
      Pinon Bill lands in the saddle it onfurls a yell like a wronged panther.
      That's what brings the Deef Woman stampedin' to the scene. She don't hear
      a morsel of all this riot Jack an' Tutt an' Pinon Bill kicks up; never
      even gets a hint of Pinon Bill's six-shooter. But with the earliest squeak
      of that infant that a-way, you bet! she comes a-runnin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The second she sees where her baby's at, up in the saddle along with
      Pinon Bill, she makes a spring for the whole outfit. We-alls stands
      lookin' on. Thar ain't one of us dares crook a finger, for this Pinon Bill
      is cool an' ca'm plumb through. He's still got the drop on the kid, while
      he's holdin' baby an' bridle both with the other arm an' hand. His sharp
      eyes is on the Deef Woman, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She springs, but she never makes it. Pinon Bill jumps his pony sideways
      out of her reach, an' at that the Deef Woman c'lapses on her face an'
      shoulder in a dead swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Adios!' says Pinon Bill, to the rest of us, backin' an' sidlin' his pony
      up the street so he don't lose sight of the play. 'Ten minutes from now
      you-alls finds this yere infant a mile from camp as safe an' solid as a
      sod house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bill,' says Enright, all at once, 'I makes you a prop'sition. Restore
      the baby to me, an' thar ain't a gent in camp who follows you a foot. I
      gives you the word of Wolfville.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Does that go?' demands Pinon Bill, turnin to Jack, who's shakin' the
      blood offen his fingers where it runs down his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It goes,' says Jack; 'goes wherever Enright sets it. I makes good his
      bluffs at all times on foot or in the stirrups.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' I takes your promise,' says Pinon Bill with a laugh, 'an' yere's the
      baby. Which now I'm goin', I don't mind confidin' in you- alls,' goes on
      this Pinon Bill, 'that I never intends to hurt that infant nohow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enright gets the child, an' in no time later that Pinon Bill is fled from
      sight. You can believe it; it takes a load offen the public mind about
      that infant when the kyards comes that a-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which the story's soon told now. It's three days later, an', seein' it's
      refreshed in our thoughts, Enright an' the rest of us is resoomed
      op'rations touchin' this Deef Woman, about gettin' her outen camp, an'
      she's beginnin' to recover her obduracy about not sayin' or hearin'
      nothin', when in comes a package by Old Monte an' the stage. It's for
      Enright from that hoss. thief, Pinon Bill. Thar's a letter an' Soo for the
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tell that Decf Woman,' says this yere Pinon Bill, 'that I has an even
      thousand dollars in my war-bags, when I stacks in her offspring ag'inst
      the camp to win; an' I deems it only squar' to divide the pot with the
      baby. The kid an' me's partners in the play that a-way, an' the enclosed
      is the kid's share. Saw this yere dinero off on her somehow; an' make her
      pull her freight. Wolfville's no good place to raise that baby.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which this Pinon Bill ain't so bad neither,' says Dan Boggs, when he
      hears it. 'Gents, I proposes the health of this outlaw. Barkeep, see what
      they takes in behalf of Pinon Bill.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letter an' the money's dead straight, an' the Deef Woman can't dodge
      or go 'round. All of which Missis Rucker takes a day off an' beats it into
      her by makin' signs. It's like two Injuns talkin'. It all winds up by the
      Deef Woman p'intin' out on her way some'ers East, an' thar ain't one of us
      ever sees the Major, the Deef Woman, the kid, nor yet this Pinon Bill, no
      more. Which this last, however, is not regarded as food for deep regrets,"

      CHAPTER XXIV. CRAWFISH JIM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Don't I never tell you the story of the death of Crawfish Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Cattleman bent upon me an eye of benevolent inquiry. I assured him
      that the details of the taking off of Crawfish Jim were as a sealed book
      to me. But I would blithely listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the fate of Crawfish Jim?"I asked. The name seemed a promise in
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' much for a fate, Crawfish's ain't," rejoined the Old Cattleman.
      "Nothin' whatever compared to some fates I keeps tabs onto. It was this
      a-way: Crawfish Jim was a sheep-man, an' has a camp out in the foothills
      of the Tres Hermanas, mebby it's thirty miles back from Wolfville. This
      yere Crawfish Jim was a pecooliar person; plumb locoed, like all
      sheep-men. They has to be crazy or they wouldn't pester 'round in no sech
      disrepootable pursoots as sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      You-all has seen these yere gents as makes pets of snakes. Mebby it's once
      in a thousand times you cuts the trail of sech a party. Snakes is kittens
      to him, an' he's likely to be packin' specimens 'round in his clothes any
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the way with this Crawfish Jim. I minds talkin' to him at his camp
      one day when I'm huntin' a bunch of cattle. The first I notes, snake
      sticks his head outen Crawfish's shirt, an' looks at me malev'lent and
      distrustful. Another protroods its nose out up by Crawfish's collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which you shore seems ha'nted of snakes?' I says, steppin' back an'
      p'intin' at the reptiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Them's my dumb companions,' says Crawfish Jim. 'They shares my
      solitood.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'You-all do seem some pop'lar with 'em,' I observes, for I saveys at once
      he's plumb off his mental reservation; an' when a party's locoed that
      a-way it makes him hostile if you derides his little game or bucks his
      notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I takes grub with Crawfish that same day; good chuck, too; mainly
      sheep-meat, salt-hoss, an' bakin'-powder biscuit. I watches him some
      narrow about them snakes he's infested with; I loathin' of 'em, an' not
      wantin' 'em to transfer no love to me, nor take to enlivenin' my
      secloosion none.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, son, this yere Crwafish Jim is as a den of serpents. I reckons now
      he has a plumb dozen mowed away in his raiment. Thar's no harm in 'em;
      bein' all bull-snakes, which is innocuous an' without p'ison, fangs, or
      convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Crawfish goes to cook, he dumps these folks oaten his clothes, an'
      lets 'em hustle an'play'round while grub's gettin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'These yere little animals,' he says, 'likes their reecreations same as
      humans, so I allers gives 'em a play-spell while I'm busy round camp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Don't they ever stampede off none?' I asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Shorely not,' says Crawfish. 'Bull-snakes is the most domestical snake
      thar is. If I'd leave one of these yere tender creatures ere over night
      he'd die of homesickness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Crawfish gets ready to bile the coffee, he tumbles the biggest
      bullsnake I'd seen yet outen the coffee-pot onto the grass. Then he fills
      the kettle with water, dumps in the coffee, an' sets her on the coals to
      stew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'This yere partic'lar snake,' says Crawfish, 'which I calls him Julius
      Caesar, is too big to tote 'round in my shirt, an' so he lives in the
      coffee-pot while I'm away, an' keeps camp for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't you yearn for no rattlesnakes to fondle?' I inquires, jest to see
      what kyard he'd play.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No,' he says, 'rattlesnakes is all right&mdash;good, sociable, moral
      snakes enough; but in a sperit of humor they may bite you or some play
      like that, an' thar you'd be. No; bull-snakes is as 'fectionate as
      rattles, an' don't run to p'ison. You don't have no inadvertencies with
      'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Can't you bust the fangs outen rattlesnakes?' I asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They grows right in ag'in,' says Crawfish, same as your finger- nails. I
      ain't got no time to go scoutin' a rattlesnake's mouth every day, lookin'
      up teeth, so I don't worry with 'em, but plays bull-snakes straight. This
      bein' dentist for rattlesnakes has resks, which the same would be foolish
      to assoom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "While grub's cookin' an' Crawfish an' me's pow-wowin', a little old dog
      Crawfish has&mdash;one of them no-account nce-dogs&mdash;comes up an'
      makes a small uprisin' off to one side with Julius Caesar. The dog yelps
      an' snaps, an' Julius Caesar blows an' strikes at him, same as a rattle.
      snake. However, they ain't doin' no harm, an' Crawfish don't pay no heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They's runnin' blazers on each other,' says Crawfish, 'an' don't mean
      nothin'. Bimeby Caribou Pete&mdash;which the same is the dog&mdash;will go
      lie down an' sleep; an' Julius Caesar will quile up ag'in him to be warm.
      Caribou, bein' a dog that a-way, is a warm-blood animal, while pore Julius
      has got cold blood like a fish. So he goes over an' camps on Caribou, an'
      all the same puts his feet on him for to be comfortable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I'm a heap interested in this yere snake knowledge, an' tells
      Crawfish so. But it sorter coppers my appetite, an' Crawfish saves on
      sheep-meat an' sow-belly by his discourse powerful. Thinkin' an' a-lookin'
      at them blessed snakes, speshul at Julius Cmsar, I shore ain't hungry
      much. But as you says: how about Crawfish Jim gettin' killed?
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day Crawfish allows all alone by himse'f he'll hop into Wolfville an'
      buy some stuff for his camp,&mdash;flour, whiskey, tobacker, air-tights,
      an' sech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's air-tights? Which you Eastern shorthorns is shore ignorant.
      Air-tights is can peaches, can tomatters, an' sim'lar bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I was sayin', along comes pore old Crawfish over to Wolfville; rides
      in on a burro. That's right, son; comes loafin' along on a burro like a
      Mexican. These yere sheep-men is that abandoned an' vulgar they ain't got
      pride to ride a hoss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Along comes Crawfish on a burro, an' it's his first visit to Wolfville.
      Yeretofore the old Cimmaron goes over to Red Dog for his plunder, the same
      bein' a busted low-down camp on the Lordsburg trail, which once holds it's
      a rival to Wolfville. It ain't, however; the same not bein' of the same
      importance, commercial, as a prairie-dog town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This time, however, Crawfish pints up for Wolfville. An' to make himse'f
      loved, I reckons, whatever does he do but bring along Julius Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't reckon now he ever plays Julius Caesar none on Red Dog. Mighty
      likely this yere was the bull-snake's first engagement. I clings to this
      notion that Red Dog never sees Julius Caesar; for if she had, them
      drunkards which inhabits said camp wouldn't have quit yellin' yet. Which
      Julius Caesar, with that Red Dog whiskey they was soaked in, would have
      shore given 'em some mighty heenous visions. Fact is, Crawfish told Jack
      Moore later he never takes Julius Caesar nowhere before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But all the same Crawfish prances into camp on this yere occasion with
      Julius bushwacked 'way 'round back in his shirt, an' sech vacant spaces
      about his person as ain't otherwise occupied a- nourishin' of minor
      bull-snakes plenty profuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course them snakes is all holdin' back, bein', after all, timid
      cattle; an' so none of us s'spects Crawfish is packin' any sech s'prises.
      None of the boys about town knows of Crawfish havin' this bull-snake habit
      but me, nohow. So the old man stampedes'round an' buys what he's after,
      an' all goes well. Nobody ain't even dreamin' of reptiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last Crawfish, havin' turned his little game for flour, air- tights,
      an' jig-juice, as I says, gets into the Red Light, an' braces up ag'in the
      bar an' calls for nose-paint all 'round. This yere is proper an' p'lite,
      an' everybody within hearin' of the yell lines up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's at this crisis Crawfish Jim starts in to make himse'f a general
      fav'ritc. Everybody's slopped out his perfoomcry, an' Dan Boggs is jest
      sayin': 'Yere's lookin' at you, Crawfish,' when that crazy-boss shepherd
      sorter swarms 'round inside his shirt with his hand, an' lugs out Julius
      Cesar be the scruff of his neck, a- squirmin' an' a-blowin', an' madder'n
      a drunken squaw. Once he gets Julius out, he spreads him 'round profuse on
      the Red Light bar an' sorter herds him with his hand to keep him from
      chargin' off among the bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gents,' says this locoed Crawfish, 'I ain't no boaster, but I offers a
      hundred to fifty, an' stands to make it up to a thousand dollars in wool
      or sheep, Julius Caesar is the fattest an' finest serpent in Arizona; also
      the best behaved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thar ain't no one takin' Crawfish's bet. The moment he slams Julius on
      the bar, more'n ten of our leadin' citizens falls to the floor in fits,
      an' emerges outen one par'xysm only to slump into another. Which we
      shorely has a general round-up of all sorts of spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Whatever's the matter of you-all people?' says Crawfish, lookin' mighty
      aghast. 'Thar's no more harm in Julius Caesar than if he's a fullblown
      rose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jack Moore, bein' marshal, of course stands his hand. It's his offishul
      dooty to play a pat hand on bull-snakes an' danger in all an' any forms.
      An' Jack does it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "While Crawfish is busy recountin' the attainments of Julius Caesar,
      a-holdin' of his pet with one hand, Jack Moore takes a snap shot at him
      along the bar with his six-shooter, an' away goes Julius Caesar's head
      like a puff of smoke. Then Moore rounds up Crawfish, an', perceivin' of
      the other bull-snakes, he searches 'em out one by one an' massacres 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Call over Doc Peets,' says Jack Moore final, 'an' bring Boggs an' Tutt
      an' the rest of these yere invalids to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets an' Enright both trails in on the lope from the New York Store.
      They hears Moore's gun-play an' is cur'ous, nacheral 'nough, to know who
      calls it. Well, they turns in an' brings the other inhabitants outen their
      fits; pendin' which Moore kills off the last remainin' bull-snake in
      Crawfish's herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son, I've seen people mad, an' I've seen 'em gay, an' I've seen 'em bit
      by grief. But I'm yere to remark I never runs up on a gent who goes plumb
      mad with sadness ontil I sees Crawfish that day Jack Moore immolates his
      bull-snake pets. He stands thar, white, an' ain't sayin' a word. Looks for
      a minute like he can't move. Crawfish don't pack no gun, or I allers
      allowed we'd had notice of him some, while them bullsnakes is cashin' in.
    </p>

      "But at last he sorter comes to, an' walks out without sayin' nothin'.
      They ain't none of us regardin' of him much at the time; bein' busy
      drinkin' an' recoverin' from the shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what do you s'pose this old Navajo does? Lopes straight over to the
      New York Store&mdash;is ca'm as a June day about it, too&mdash;an' gets a
      six-shooter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next information we gets of Crawfish, 'bang!' goes his new gun, an'
      the bullet cuts along over Jack Moore's head too high for results. New gun
      that a-way, an' Crawfish not up on his practice; of course he overshoots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the pore old murderer never does get a second crack. I reckons
      eight people he has interested shoots all at once, an' Crawfish Jim quits
      this earthly deal unanimous. He stops every bullet; eight of 'em, like I
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thar ain't a man of us who don't feel regrets; but what's the use? Thar
      we be, up ag'inst the deal, with Crawfish clean locoed. It's the only
      wagon-track out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I shore hopes he's on the hot trail of them bull-snakes of his'n,' says
      Dan Boggs, as we lays Crawfish out on a monte-table. 'Seems like he
      thought monstrous well of 'em, an' it would mighty likely please him to
      run up on 'em where he's gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever did we do? Why, we digs a grave out back of the dance-hall an'
      plants Crawfish an' his pets tharin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I reckons we better bury them reptiles, too,' says Doc Peets, as we gets
      Crawfish stretched out all comfortable in the bottom. 'If he's lookin'
      down on these yere ceremonies it'll make him feel easier.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doc Peets is mighty sentimental an' romantic that a-way, an' allers
      thinks of the touchin' things to do, which I more'n once notices likewise,
      that a gent bein' dead that a-way allers brings out the soft side of
      Peets's nacher. You bet! he's plumb sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We counts in the snakes. Thar's 'leven of 'em besides Julius Caesar;
      which we lays him on Crawfish's breast. You can find the grave to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shore! we sticks up a headboard. It says on it, the same bein' furnished
      by Doc Peets&mdash;an' I wants to say Doc Peets is the best eddicated gent
      in Arizona-as follows

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF
     CRAWFISH JIM, JULIUS CAESAR
     AND
     ELEVEN OTHER BULL SNAKES,
     THEY MEANT WELL,
     BUT THEY MISUNDERSTOOD EXISTENCE
     AND DIED.

     THIS BOARD WAS REARED BY AN
     ADMIRING CIRELE OF FRIENDS
     WHO WAS WITH DECEASED
     TO THE LAST.

      "An' don't you-all know, son, this yere onfortunate weedin' out of pore
      Crawfish that a-way, sorter settles down on the camp an' preys on us for
      mighty likely it's a week. It shorely is a source of gloom. Moreover, it
      done gives Dan Boggs the fan-tods. As I relates prior, Boggs is emotional
      a whole lot, an' once let him get what you-all calls a shock&mdash;same,
      for instance, as them bull-snakes&mdash;its shore due to set Boggs's
      intellects to millin'. An' that's what happens now. We-alls don't get
      Boggs; bedded down none for ten days, his visions is that acoote.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Which of course,' says Boggs, while we-all s settin' up administerin'
      things to him, 'which of course I'm plumb aware these yere is mere
      illoosions; but all the same, as cl'ar as ever I notes an ace, no matter
      where I looks at, I discerns that Julius Caesar serpent a-regardin' me
      reproachful outen the atmospher. An' gents, sech spectacles lets me out a
      heap every time. You-alls can gamble, I ain't slumberin' none with no
      snake-spook that a-way a-gyardin' of my dreams.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all thar is to the death of Crawfish Jim. Thar ain't no harm in
      him, nor yet, I reckons, in Julius Caesar an' the rest of Crawfish's
      fam'ly. But the way they gets tangled up with Wolfville, an' takes to
      runnin' counter to public sentiment an' them eight six- shooters, Crawfish
      an' his live-stock has to go."
